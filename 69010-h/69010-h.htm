<h3><i>SCENE. A beautiful garden; rustic tables and chairs; to the right a
castle, massive, elegant, imposing. Don Manuel D’Acosta, standing
on the veranda, absorbed in thought. Enter Marquis D’Acosta.</i></h3>

<p>MARQ. Manuel.—Manuel.</p>

<p>MAN. You called?</p>

<p>MARQ. Of what were you thinking so intently?</p>

<p>MAN. A little plan that I imagine will surprise Napoleon somewhat.</p>

<p>MARQ. He will at least reciprocate. He has prepared a surprise
for us.</p>

<p>MAN. How so?</p>

<p>MARQ. I have just heard that we are to be sent to-morrow to the
castle of Valencay.</p>

<p>MAN. The devil!</p>

<p>MARQ. As “guests of France,” our host feels that he must provide
better lodgings for us.</p>

<p>MAN. Safer ones, you mean.</p>

<p>MARQ. I warned you that your zeal for Ferdinand would lead us
to prison.</p>

<p>MAN. Long live his Majesty, Ferdinand the VII!</p>

<p>MARQ. And Mariana must share our prison.</p>

<p>MAN. Better that than freedom with others.</p>

<p>MARQ. You talk like a youth. Mariana has French blood in her
veins.</p>

<p>MAN. She has Spanish blood in her veins too. She is your niece
and my cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>MARQ. She has no sympathy for Ferdinand.</p>

<p>MAN. Because she has been taught to distrust him. Will Captain
Durand’s company remain here or escort us to
Valencay.</p>

<p>MARQ. I do not know.</p>

<p>MAN. It is incredible that you let her speak to that man.</p>

<p>MARQ. He is not a lunatic.</p>

<p>MAN. He is worse: he is a <i>poseur</i>. You know very well that a
girl’s admiration is always captured by such a tale of heroism
as he has been at pains to have circulated.</p>

<p>MARQ. What heroism?</p>

<p>MAN. An absurd story that Napoleon sent him with a message to
the Empress; that five or six rowdy Spaniards, thinking to
make a grand <i>coup</i>, and under the impression that they were
military instructions, waylaid him and demanded the papers
upon him.</p>

<p>MARQ. And then?</p>

<p>MAN. Oh, then my gallant proved himself. He switched out his
sword and bade them advance. And the men, not recognizing
him as a hero, advanced and were slain.</p>

<p>MARQ. It was a brave act.</p>

<p>MAN. If one accredit it, as you so generously do.</p>

<p>MARQ. Manuel, I have used, and will use my influence in your
favor. Beyond that I can do nothing.</p>

<p>MAN. Say will do nothing. (<i class="dir">exit.</i>)</p>

<p>MARQ. Poor boy! Poor hot-head! (<i class="dir">enter Mariana.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. What a beautiful day, uncle!</p>

<p>MARQ. Hedged in as we are, I cannot see it.</p>

<p>MAR. But overhead the way is all ours.</p>

<p>MARQ. You are very light-hearted these days.</p>

<p>MAR. There are so many beauties on beauties, and still out of
sight and hearing, an infinite comfort, as if God had centered
the Universe into a nesting hollow for us.</p>

<p>MARQ. You know, Mariana, that I wish you to marry Manuel.</p>

<p>MAR. Uncle—</p>

<p>MARQ. You know that your father wished it; left you his fortune
only upon that condition.</p>

<p>MAR. Yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>MARQ. Think of these things. Do not let the caprice of a moment
weigh against the wishes of your dead. (<i class="dir">exit; Mariana
sits absorbed in thought; enter Jean Durand; he has his left
arm lightly bandaged; he comes up behind her, puts his right
arm around her.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">starting</i>) Oh! It is you.</p>

<p>JEAN. I am jealous of those long thoughts of yours.</p>

<p>MAR. Are you?</p>

<p>JEAN. Jealous of all things that claim you; the winds that whisper
to you all day long, the dreams that make you smile or sigh,
the moon-beams that enfold you at night, the thoughts that
bid you pay attention.</p>

<p>MAR. I know a magician who converts all those things to his use.</p>

<p>JEAN. I know an enchantress who makes him believe he does.</p>

<p>MAR. He praises my eyes, my lips, my hair, and I lie awake at
night thinking about the happiness and the wonder of their
being beautiful to him.</p>

<p>JEAN. The wonder would be in their being anything else.</p>

<p>MAR. Even for my chance words, he creates meanings of wisdom
and wit.</p>

<p>JEAN. Because, like the sun’s rays, they beautify even the smallest
things.</p>

<p>MAR. I am afraid he does not hear me; that he does not see me.</p>

<p>JEAN. He loves you, sweetheart. God has put no appraiser in
the world half so infallible as Love. Do you know why I
was jealous of that long thought of yours?</p>

<p>MAR. No. (<i class="dir">she bends her head and lightly touches with her lips his
wounded arm.</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Because it seemed a sad thought.</p>

<p>MAR. It was. I was thinking of Pedro.</p>

<p>JEAN. Your brother?</p>

<p>MAR. Yes. Do you know, Jean, I am glad I cannot have the fortune
my father left.</p>

<p>JEAN. I am glad that I shall be forever in your debt for the privilege
of making you another.</p>

<p>MAR. Even if I had not met you, I could never have married
Manuel, and, in that case, the fortune would have reverted to
the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. In that case it would have been your brother’s happiness
and privilege to have shared his with you.</p>

<p>MAR. My brother was not even mentioned in the will. That is
why I am glad I cannot have the money.</p>

<p>JEAN. What was his offense?</p>

<p>MAR. Nothing, that we know of. He is not really my brother,
you know; only an adopted brother.</p>

<p>JEAN. French?</p>

<p>MAR. No, Spanish; adopted by my parents before my birth, when
they had despaired of having a child of their own.</p>

<p>JEAN. Then he is older than you?</p>

<p>MAR. Ten years.</p>

<p>JEAN. Where is he now?</p>

<p>MAR. We do not know. Five years ago, (when we left France to
go to Spain, after my father’s death) he ceased answering my
letters. I begged him to write to me—to love me, but—</p>

<p>JEAN. He is an ingrate.</p>

<p>MAR. Oh, he is not. He is hurt and humiliated by father’s will.
He had been treated as a son during his life-time; he must
have supposed he would still be treated as a son when father
died. My heart aches for poor Pedro.</p>

<p>JEAN. He ought to be a happy man.</p>

<p>MAR. Happy?</p>

<p>JEAN. You pray for him—long for him—love him.</p>

<p>MAR. I pray for others.</p>

<p>JEAN. For me?</p>

<p>MAR. My best prayers.</p>

<p>JEAN. And long for me sometimes?</p>

<p>MAR. Always—when you give me a chance.</p>

<p>JEAN. If I were forced to give you a long chance?</p>

<p>MAR. Jean—</p>

<p>JEAN. Let me speak to your uncle, sweetheart.</p>

<p>MAR. It would be useless.</p>

<p>JEAN. He is kind to you; he loves you.</p>

<p>MAR. He loves Manuel better. He is determined on the marriage.</p>

<p>JEAN. But if he saw your happiness is at stake?</p>

<p>MAR. He would call it caprice. You see my father’s will makes it
easy for him to think desire, duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. Then marry me, sweetheart. Give me the right to make
your peace secure. All that you have dreamed of me I will
try to be; all that you have hoped for me I will work to
achieve; all that you believe of me I will die to prove. Marry
me, sweetheart. Say the yes that is in your eyes.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">closing them</i>) My eyes are tell-tales which should be
punished.</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">kissing them</i>) Your eyes are altar lamps to Truth. Say
the yes that is in your heart. (<i class="dir">Mariana throws her arms
around him</i>) My sweetheart! To-night?</p>

<p>MAR. Oh, Jean—</p>

<p>JEAN. This is our last day here.</p>

<p>MAR. Last!</p>

<p>JEAN. To-morrow Ferdinand and his Court will be removed to the
castle of Valencay.</p>

<p>MAR. And you? Do you accompany us?</p>

<p>JEAN. I do not know. I have not yet received my orders.</p>

<p>MAR. You will not leave me, Jean?</p>

<p>JEAN. Does one leave the light, air, warmth, life? I shall come to
you this afternoon.</p>

<p>MAR. My uncle is calling—</p>

<p>JEAN. <i>Au revoir</i>, sweetheart. (<i class="dir">kisses her; exit Mariana; Beluche
enters R. U.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">to sentry at back</i>) Is Captain Durand here?</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">overhearing him, and turning up stage from L. I. E.</i>) Ah,
Beluche!</p>

<p>BEL. You seem very happy. Are you not yet tired of your Spanish
watch?</p>

<p>JEAN. Tired? I wish it might last forever.</p>

<p>BEL. We shall have you Spanishized next; praising the senors;
adoring the senoritas.</p>

<p>JEAN. The senoritas—</p>

<p>BEL. Thank heaven, I can hear your rhapsodies seldom.</p>

<p>JEAN. You’ll force me to think soon, Beluche, that some fair senorita
has jilted you heartlessly.</p>

<p>BEL. Would the thought suggest any caution?</p>

<p>JEAN. You admit?</p>

<p>BEL. I admit that to deserve is better than to possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. Well parried!</p>

<p>BEL. And, as against polite Spaniards, I admit to a preference for
honest cannibals.</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">laughing</i>) And the New World?</p>

<p>BEL. And the New World. I have heard tales of it to make the
heart beat and the eye lighten.</p>

<p>JEAN. Fairy tales.</p>

<p>BEL. Matters of fact; of wonderful fortune-making, of breathless
daring.</p>

<p>JEAN. Accomplished by whom?</p>

<p>BEL. The Carthagenians (<i class="dir">fiercely</i>) against the Spanish.</p>

<p>JEAN. Oh—the Caribbean sea exploits? Pirates.</p>

<p>BEL. I beg your pardon. Privateers.</p>

<p>JEAN. I believe you <i>are</i> in earnest.</p>

<p>BEL. I am going there.</p>

<p>JEAN. To the New World?</p>

<p>BEL. To the New World. Will you go with me?</p>

<p>JEAN. My dear Beluche, impossible.</p>

<p>BEL. Then good-by. I must hurry back. (<i class="dir">exit</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Wait a moment. Beluche—What an eccentric! (<i class="dir">looking
towards Mariana’s window</i>) But he does not know that I have
found a new world already. (<i class="dir">exit; enter Pedro R, U. E.; he
sees Jean exiting; looks after him gloomily</i>)</p>

<p>PED. Captain Durand! More officious than ever I presume, since
the Emperor has been pleased to praise him. Confound the
luck! To have to break off in the midst of my furlough for
cursed gambling debts and threatened disgrace. However,
my young Captain, you’ve been a sufficient thorn in my side;
you won’t have a chance to step in my shoes yet awhile.—I
must see Manuel. Re-enforced as he will be by Mariana’s
fortune, his friendship appeals to me. (<i class="dir">enter Manuel</i>) How
goes the world with my brother-in-law elect?</p>

<p>MAN. Pedro! It is ages since we have heard from you. Mariana
has been in much sorrow about it.</p>

<p>PED. I hope then to give her added joy on her wedding day.</p>

<p>MAN. Her wedding day?</p>

<p>PED. The earliest time fixed by her father for her marriage is at
hand. I assume your eagerness to profit by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>MAN. You assume hers too?</p>

<p>PED. Why not?</p>

<p>MAN. For the most potent of all reasons. She does not love me.</p>

<p>PED. She says so. Women are fond of entreaty.</p>

<p>MAN. I have entreated.</p>

<p>PED. They are fond of mastery. You are faint-hearted, despondent.</p>

<p>MAN. I am reasonable.</p>

<p>PED. You speak your defeat. There is no other man, is there?</p>

<p>MAN. Curse him!</p>

<p>PED. What sort of man?</p>

<p>MAN. Oh, a young swashbuckler, lately promoted to a Captaincy
by Napoleon,—Jean Durand, by name.</p>

<p>PED. That man!</p>

<p>MAN. What of him?</p>

<p>PED. She must not marry him. One thing more: do you love her?</p>

<p>MAN. Pedro d’Acosta!</p>

<p>PED. Your pardon. I had not thought of the fortune. Your own
is sufficient guarantee against financial motives.</p>

<p>MAN. I love her, certainly.</p>

<p>PED. Then—I shall be able to help you.</p>

<p>MAN. She will not listen to you.</p>

<p>PED. I shall not ask her to do so. Do not let her know that I am
in Bayonne.</p>

<p>MAN. You wear a French Colonel’s uniform. She will hear of you
through Captain Durand.</p>

<p>PED. She will hear only of his Colonel, whose name is Tolosa.</p>

<p>MAN. But you?</p>

<p>PED. I am Colonel Tolosa. Five years ago I dropped the name of
my adopted parents, and assumed that of the little Spanish
town in which I was born.</p>

<p>MAN. You joined the French army!</p>

<p>PED. For which you shall be thankful. To return to Mariana:
there is no use arguing with a woman in love. We must pit
our wits against Durand’s, letting her know nothing of our
interference. Go to her. Press your suit, besiege her with
entreaty. Determine to win and you shall.</p>

<p>MAN. If you speak truth—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>PED. There is no if but in yourself. Sweep aside all denial, rush
her along the current of your will; make her breathless,
powerless. When she recovers, she will admire, love you.</p>

<p>MAN. Pedro—</p>

<p>PED. No thanks, I’ll help you, if you will help yourself.</p>

<p>MAN. When shall I see you again?</p>

<p>PED. Leave that to me. <i>Au revoir.</i> (<i class="dir">exit</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">enthusiastically</i>) If Pedro be right!—(<i class="dir">enter Mariana with
a basket for gathering flowers</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. Uncle has been seeking you, Manuel.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">advancing towards her</i>) And you?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">purposely misunderstanding</i>) He did not need me.</p>

<p>MAN. Have <i>you</i> been seeking me?</p>

<p>MAR. Why should I?</p>

<p>MAN. Why, indeed! You know that my love needs no bidding;
that it is—</p>

<p>MAR. That it is very unbidden.</p>

<p>MAN. That it is the sum of my existence; that it has ruined my
life for all things save worship of one idea—you; longing for
one good—you; hatred for one opposition—yours.</p>

<p>MAR. I must gather my flowers.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">savagely</i>) You are in a cutting mood. Allow me to hold
your basket for you.</p>

<p>MAR. It will do as well on the ground, (<i class="dir">she lets it fall to the ground;
Manuel picks it up.</i>) I prefer it on the ground.</p>

<p>MAN. I prefer to hold it.</p>

<p>MAR. But as the basket is mine—(<i class="dir">goes to take it.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">retaining it</i>) And you are mine—</p>

<p>MAR. You know my answer to that.</p>

<p>MAN. My dearest, in the days when our great, great uncle was a
corsair—</p>

<p>MAR. Spare me the recital of his feats.</p>

<p>MAN. He would have made short shrift of your little sins of hesitancy
and doubt.</p>

<p>MAR. Hesitancy!</p>

<p>MAN. He would have seized you, body and soul. He would have
understood no denial. He would have seen no sense in it.</p>

<p>MAR. A corsair you called him. Another name for thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>MAN. For poetry, freedom, reckless bravery!</p>

<p>MAR. For underhandedness and skulking cowardice. I abhor his
very name.</p>

<p>MAN. That is impossible. It is also mine.</p>

<p>MAR. Your boast of it does you no credit.</p>

<p>MAN. Mariana, my best beloved, do not drive me to desperation. I
am patient.</p>

<p>MAR. I am not, especially when you seek to overawe me by telling
me what a notorious pirate would do in your place.</p>

<p>MAN. But I—</p>

<p>MAR. Please give me my basket.</p>

<p>MAN. You are not so severe on all adventurers; Captain Durand,
for instance.</p>

<p>MAR. Captain Durand!</p>

<p>MAN. Yes. Do you suppose I do not see how he has hoodwinked
you into admiration, love perhaps, by his tales of valor and
gallantry.</p>

<p>MAR. Please give me my basket.</p>

<p>MAN. You shall not put me aside in this manner. You shall realize
that I love you and that you shall love me.</p>

<p>MAR. Why such vehemence since you are confident?</p>

<p>MAN. Because you are cruel; because day by day you torture me.</p>

<p>MAR. I have never given you any hope.</p>

<p>MAN. You give me none now?</p>

<p>MAR. I give you none now.</p>

<p>MAN. Ha! ha! “Sweep aside all denial; rush her along the current
of your will. When she recovers, she will admire, love
you.”</p>

<p>MAR. What?</p>

<p>MAN. There is your basket. (<i class="dir">exit</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. What did he mean? I wonder—Oh, I wish Jean would
come. (<i class="dir">enter Jean</i>) Well?</p>

<p>JEAN. Bad news. Col. Tolosa has returned.</p>

<p>MAR. He orders you—?</p>

<p>JEAN. To remain here.</p>

<p>MAR. Oh!</p>

<p>JEAN. He must have divined, you see, that I wanted to go.</p>

<p>MAR. Despicable!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. But he cannot divine the glory and happiness that will be
mine in remaining, since you will remain with me.</p>

<p>MAR. You don’t think, Jean, that there would be any hope of
gaining uncle’s consent?</p>

<p>JEAN. There would be scant time in which to gain it. (<i class="dir">enter Pedro
and Manuel at back</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Manuel, too—You have no idea how insistent Manuel has become,
almost to the point of threats.</p>

<p>JEAN. Ah, put an end to such unpleasant possibilities, sweetheart.
Let us be married to-night. Father Cuthbert is here—has
just arrived.</p>

<p>MAR. Father John Cuthbert?</p>

<p>JEAN. The same. Do you know him?</p>

<p>MAR. He was our parish priest in the old days in France. Pedro
and I used to walk with him often.</p>

<p>JEAN. He is one of my best friends.</p>

<p>MAR. Will he be here long?</p>

<p>JEAN. Unfortunately, no. He is only going through—will be leaving
in the early morning for America. But are you not glad,
sweetheart, that he is here to marry us?</p>

<p>MAR. Yes.</p>

<p>JEAN. I had almost forgotten. I must get a ring.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">touching the ring on his left hand</i>) This will do.</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">taking it off</i>) What! This little silver thing? It is all
battered.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">taking it from him</i>) But more precious so than if chased by
the finest workers of France; bent, and nearly broken, and
stained with blood, it is an earnest of my lover’s valor; of the
fearless worth that won him his Emperor’s commendation.
(<i class="dir">she kisses the ring, and slips it on her finger</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Did I not tell you, sweetheart, that your thoughts, like the
sun’s rays, beautify even the smallest things? Now listen.
To-night, whenever my best opportunity offers, I shall come
to you. I shall make my presence known by softly singing
the refrain of “<i>Mon Coeur a Toi</i>.” If all be well, come down
to me in the garden.</p>

<p>MAR. Oh, Jean, there is a great white tempest in my soul! It
awes me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. There is a greater one it seems to me in mine, but it does
not awe me. It builds me—up to heaven. For the last time,
my precious one, good-by.</p>

<p>MAR. Good-by.</p>

<p>JEAN. To-night. (<i class="dir">he kisses her; exeunt Jean and Mariana</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">advancing</i>) You see the result of “sweeping aside all denial.”
It has hurried her into marriage.</p>

<p>PED. It has done nothing of the sort. They were bound to find
some excuses for marrying.</p>

<p>MAN. They shall not marry. I’ll warn my father—lock her in—</p>

<p>PED. And ruin your chances forever.</p>

<p>MAN. I have no chances.</p>

<p>PED. If you will give me Mariana’s fortune for my good offices, I’ll
ensure you the defeat of your rival.</p>

<p>MAN. Mariana’s fortune!</p>

<p>PED. What I shall do requires care and planning, and is not unaccompanied
by risk. You have an ample fortune of your
own. I have, thanks to my father’s kindness, nothing—less
than nothing, since I am deeply in debt and in danger of disgrace,
even dismissal from the army.</p>

<p>MAN. But Mariana’s fortune—</p>

<p>PED. Will be yours.</p>

<p>MAN. I cannot promise that.</p>

<p>PED. Then I cannot risk what I had thought of.</p>

<p>MAN. It would be useless. I have no chance.</p>

<p>PED. Certainly Durand seems to have left you none.</p>

<p>MAN. Damn him!</p>

<p>PED. He was not even ruffled by Mariana’s confession of your
desperate wooing.</p>

<p>MAN. I’ll kill him!</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">amused</i>) As for your threats, he did not consider them.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">turning fiercely upon him</i>) Stop that!</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">coolly and indifferently</i>) Good-by. (<i class="dir">going</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Pedro! Will you not see the folks and use your influence
with Mariana? She might listen to you.</p>

<p>PED. I think it very unlikely.</p>

<p>MAN. Wait a moment. What if your plan should fail?</p>

<p>PED. What plan?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>MAN. About Durand.</p>

<p>PED. It would not fail.</p>

<p>MAN. Mariana, of course, would know nothing of our agreement?</p>

<p>PED. Certainly nothing.</p>

<p>MAN. Very well then. I do not believe it possible for me to win
her, but it will be a satisfaction to have outwitted Durand.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">handing him a pencil and paper upon which he has been writing.</i>)
Will you sign this?</p>

<p>MAN. My word is sufficient.</p>

<p>PED. Certainly. Yet as a matter of business, I prefer to have
your signature.</p>

<p>MAN. I do not believe anything will come of it. (<i class="dir">signs</i>)</p>

<p>PED. Your marriage will come of it. But there is no time to lose.
Come with me. (<i class="dir">exeunt; night has come on, the moon is rising;
enter Jean</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Dellonne is on watch. I’ll—Why, Beluche! (<i class="dir">enter Beluche</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. I could not leave without asking you once more to come with me.</p>

<p>JEAN. How leave? Have you resigned from the army?</p>

<p>BEL. I have. I am disgusted with Napoleon’s manner of treating
the Spaniards; sick of inaction. Come with me.</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">laughs</i>) My dear Beluche, will the fair senorita allow
your departure?</p>

<p>BEL. What senorita?</p>

<p>JEAN. The creator of this restlessness, this love-hate.</p>

<p>BEL. Do I look like a fool?</p>

<p>JEAN. Heaven forbid!</p>

<p>BEL. Heaven has nothing to do with it. I am a fool.</p>

<p>JEAN. My dear Beluche—</p>

<p>BEL. I bear on my shoulders a convict’s brand—not a regular
mark, but the scars of lashings. I am a young man no longer
because seven of my years have been spent in prison—a
prison to which my fair senorita and her Spanish hypocrites
sent me. And it is still a daily humiliation to me that she has
a miniature of me to show her friends; the fool whose face
she placed upon a serpent’s head—a fitting locket truly.
Probably Antonio Cardez dangles it at his watch chain now—the
fat, insentient beast!—the very kind of man sure to exhibit
jewelry on his expansive front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. My dear Beluche, I had no idea—</p>

<p>BEL. You have none now—about Spaniards. Are you not under
command of a Spanish colonel?</p>

<p>JEAN. He must be French at heart since he is a commanding officer
in Napoleon’s army. Do you know him?</p>

<p>BEL. No, I have never seen him.</p>

<p>JEAN. I will confess to you that without reason—simply on instinct—the
best support for your plea lies in my intuition
about that one Spaniard.</p>

<p>BEL. Ah!</p>

<p>JEAN. But the fact remains. I have no cause to hate the Spanish.
If I should ever have, and if my chances of avenging myself
should be forever lost to me in the Old World, then I will go
with you to the New.</p>

<p>BEL. Then! To-morrow and her dupes! Good by. Remember
that I liked you. (<i class="dir">exit</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Poor Beluche! (<i class="dir">sentry passes at back</i>). Dellonne—(<i class="dir">sentry
salutes</i>). I’ll relieve you of duty for awhile. Hold yourself
in readiness to return at a signal from me. (<i class="dir">Sentry salutes
and exit; Jean looks after him, turns to Mariana’s window and
is advancing towards it, when Manuel appears.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Good evening, Captain.</p>

<p>JEAN. Good evening.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">descending into the garden</i>) Do you go with us to-morrow?</p>

<p>JEAN. I do not.</p>

<p>MAN. Have a cigar? (<i class="dir">offering him a cigar</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Thanks. I have just had one.</p>

<p>MAN. Not with me. Try one. (<i class="dir">Jean takes a cigar</i>)</p>

<p>JEAN. Thanks. (<i class="dir">Manuel offers him a light, then lights his own
cigar</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. I suppose there is no telling when we shall see you again?</p>

<p>JEAN. We may meet.</p>

<p>MAN. In case we don’t, will you remember that I am much indebted
to you?</p>

<p>JEAN. For what?</p>

<p>MAN. Oh, a thousand things. You do not, I see, estimate rightly
the appreciation you provoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>JEAN. I—</p>

<p>MAN. Shall we walk? (<i class="dir">Jean stands dazed</i>) Are you ill?</p>

<p>JEAN. Nothing.... A little dizziness.... (<i class="dir">staggers to bench
near table, sits and sinks face downward upon the table; Manuel
watches him, then beckons to a servant who enters, bearing
a bottle of liquor; exit servant; Manuel drinks from the bottle,
then empties the remainder of the contents upon the ground and
places the bottle on the table by Jean. He then exchanges his
hat and cloak for those of Jean, goes to Mariana’s window and
softly sings Mon Coeur a Toi. After a moment, her door opens
and Mariana comes down to him with extended hands. Manuel
hastily wraps her cloak around her and leads her down the garden
path. Exeunt Manuel and Mariana. Then from the distance,
comes a cry of fear and horror.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">without</i>) Jean! Jean! (<i class="dir">Jean starts up at the cry, but falls
dazed and helpless, back into a troubled sleep. A short silence;
then a sudden alarm sounds. Lights flash. A cry behind
the scenes: “The prisoners have escaped!” and a group
of soldiers, led by Colonel Tolosa, rushes on the scene.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. Who is on watch?</p>

<p>DELL. Captain Durand. He relieved me half an hour ago. (<i class="dir">they
see Jean asleep; Pedro goes up to him; picks up the bottle at
his side and lets it fall to the ground. Jean raises his head;
struggles to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. Captain Durand, you are drunk. You were sleeping at your
post; you have allowed your prisoners to escape. What have
you to say in your own defense?</p>

<p>JEAN. (<i class="dir">staggering semi-conscious to centre.</i>) Mariana....
(<i class="dir">falls.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">looking him over coldly.</i>) Remove his sword and order a
summons prepared for a court-martial.</p>

<h3><i>SCENE I. Six years later. L’Hotel des Exiles; New Orleans. A
large, dark-paneled, low-ceilinged room. Enter Leon Duval and
Pedro.</i></h3>

<p>DUV. You resided in Spain until within the last few years, did you
not?</p>

<p>PED. Yes; our family belonged to Ferdinand’s Court, but when
His Majesty was overthrown, our fortunes all suffering in the
downfall, my uncle removed to New Orleans.</p>

<p>DUV. Where your own overthrow was completed by Cupid. To
be frank with you, you are perfectly eligible to my daughter’s
hand;—I like you—but owing to her youth and the great
wealth that will be hers, (she is my sole heir) I am constrained
to caution. Personally, the weight of my authority will be
in your favor, but in the meantime we must wait until you
have money enough to raise you in worldly minds above the
suspicion of fortune hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>PED. For your frankness, even though it wound me, I thank you.
My only protest arises from suspense lest in the interim Bella
should prefer another; even that she may prefer another now.</p>

<p>DUV. I have never had any trouble with women, no matter who the
woman. All that is necessary is to coax them in the proper
way, so as to make them think they are yielding through
grace and not necessity.</p>

<p>PED. A rare art.</p>

<p>DUV. An easy one. I pledge you my word that Bella will wed as
I dictate. (<i class="dir">enter several legislators and politicians.</i>)</p>

<p>1st POL. It is plain to see that the British have designs on this
city.</p>

<p>1st LEG. They won’t amount to anything. (<i class="dir">enter Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. They will amount to ruin, unless Lafitte be checked in time.</p>

<p>2nd POL. Confound it all, he must be.</p>

<p>DUV. He is not only a terror to the State, a growing paralysis upon
its commerce, but a menace to the entire country; uncatchable,
unrestrainable.</p>

<p>PED. The country’s trade with Spain has been well nigh ruined.</p>

<p>1st LEG. Yes and her neutrality laws put at naught.</p>

<p>DUV. Worse still; the entire respectability of the State is being debauched
underhandedly into complicity with this Emperor of
Barataria under penalty of being ruined.</p>

<p>2nd LEG. The Governor must be urged to act.</p>

<p>1st POL. He cannot remain unheedful of the petition we will send
him.</p>

<p>DUV. To business! (<i class="dir">exeunt</i>.)</p>

<p>BEL. Ha! ha! Petition away, my gallants! The man who from
public disgrace has been able to build himself into a power, a
whole country fears because it cannot subdue, need have no
apprehension arising from petitions. Jean Durand of the
French army was a very different man from Jean Lafitte,
Emperor of Barataria. “If he should ever have cause to hate
the Spanish!” he promised me. The cause must have been
grievous—a woman, of course—the cause is always a woman,
though Jean has said nothing to me about it. However,
she has made him a good hater. For that much I am beholden
to her.—But I must see Lafitte about the Creole. I have suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
about that ship. He has been away so many months,
the men are becoming unruly. I had thought to find him here
looking up old Darblee about his <i>protege</i>, Dominique. (<i class="dir">enter
Baptiste.</i>) Has Master Dominique returned, Baptiste?</p>

<p>BAP. No sah, not jess ’zactly. I’ze lookin’ into dis week fo’ ’im.</p>

<p>BEL. Still got that little habit of looking into things?</p>

<p>BAP. Yes sah, an’ dat minds me. Does you know, marser, if dem
bloodhounds bite hard?</p>

<p>BEL. Pretty hard.</p>

<p>BAP. Is dey any chance fo’ a man to git ’way fum em?</p>

<p>BEL. They have been known to swim a stream and find the scent
on the other side. Don’t be foolhardy, Baptiste.</p>

<p>BAP. Who me? <i>I</i> ain’t got no idee o’ runnin’ ’way. Naw, sah.
I jess want to fin’ out fo’ a fren o’ mine.</p>

<p>BEL. Isn’t Mr Darblee a kind master?</p>

<p>BAP. Dey ain no better. Ef dat daid man dint hanker roun’ ’ere
so continuous—</p>

<p>BEL. What man?</p>

<p>BAP. Yo see dat mask over de door? Dat man’s sperrit dogs me
all de time;—won’t even let anything stay whar I puts it.
Dis very mornin’, I had done put marser Darblee’s slippers
in de sun to air an’ wen I went to look fo’ ’em dey uz done

<p>BEL. A thief, perhaps.</p>

<p>BAP. Naw sah. Dey ain no body kin git in de co’t widout me seein’

<p>BEL. Mr. Darblee may not ask for the slippers. (<i class="dir">exeunt; enter Darblee
and Dominique.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. And here is the old home again!</p>

<p>DAR. And the old uncle to give you welcome.</p>

<p>DOM. Spain is a pretty far way off, eh uncle?</p>

<p>DAR. But with Lafitte!—You know, Dominique, I have served
Lafitte for years and yet have never seen him.</p>

<p>DOM. You have no idea the wonderful man he is!</p>

<p>DAR. Yes?</p>

<p>DOM. Oh, a man to admire, copy, love; a man to spend your life
with, if it were not for Bella. How is Bella? Have you seen
her? Is she well?—(<i class="dir">notices a bulge in Darblee’s pockets.</i>) What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
on earth have you in your pockets?</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">pulling out a pair of slippers.</i>) I bought them for you and wore
them once to see if they were comfortable. This morning I
found them in the broiling sun, put there to air by Baptiste.
Fortunately I was in time to save the coloring.</p>

<p>DOM. Baptiste would seem to have opinions of your feet. Thank
you, uncle. They are beautiful.</p>

<p>DAR. Have you had any <i>ecrevisse</i> gumbo since you left home?</p>

<p>DOM. No indeed; nothing so good. (<i class="dir">he puts the slippers on a chair and
walks to the right of mask door to take a look at the old place.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. I wonder whether Baptiste has ordered those <i>ecrevisses</i>?

<p>BAP. Yes sah. (<i class="dir">Dominique re-enters just as Baptiste hides the slippers in some

my slippers. (<i class="dir">puts them in his pockets; deep sailor pockets, that make no
bulges; enter Darblee.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Tell me about that shipwreck.</p>

<p>DOM. It was purely imaginary.</p>

<p>DAR. What!</p>

<p>DOM. I dared not say I had not been shipwrecked when Lizbette
said I had. Bella would have had no further faith in me.</p>

<p>DAR. Nonsense.</p>

<p>DOM. Of course.</p>

<p>DAR. You don’t mean—</p>

<p>DOM. Yes I do—every time I think of the day I chanced to speak
of that old voo-doo to Bella.—How about Baptiste? Is he
still as much troubled by ghosts as ever?</p>

<p>DAR. I suppose so. He’s flightier than ever. (<i class="dir">enter Bella.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">catching both her hands.</i>) At last!</p>

<p>BELLA. I received your note just in time. (<i class="dir">exit Darblee.</i>) I told father
I wished to go to confession, so he accompanied me to the
Church. I must get back before he returns. And oh, what
do you think?</p>

<p>DOM. I love you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>BELLA. A most delightful thing has happened.</p>

<p>DOM. You love me.</p>

<p>BELLA. Be serious. Our love seems more hopeless than ever.</p>

<p>DOM. What!</p>

<p>BELLA. I said seems. There is a suitor for my hand whom father
insists that I shall marry and father himself is more inveterate
than ever against the men he calls pirates.</p>

<p>DOM. But you?</p>

<p>BELLA. Oh, I am glad that the suitor has come because otherwise
I would never have been easy in my mind. I would always
have been expecting trouble.</p>

<p>DOM. Bella,—</p>

<p>BELLA. Lizbette <i>said</i> there would be an obstacle more serious
than all the others—even than the shipwreck.</p>

<p>DOM. Lizbette be—</p>

<p>BELLA. Dominique!</p>

<p>DOM. But I protest—</p>

<p>BELLA. Now listen. Didn’t you yourself tell me about Lizbette’s
wonderful prediction long ago?</p>

<p>DOM. A coincidence.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">reprovingly.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>DOM. And I furthermore declare that I never was shipwrecked.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">claps her hands.</i>) Ha, ha! Lizbette <i>said</i> you would tell
stories and get others to tell stories in order to shake my faith
in her!</p>

<p>DOM. What is this suitor’s name?</p>

<p>BELLA. I can’t tell you.</p>

<p>DOM. I shall see your father.</p>

<p>BELLA. I won’t have it. Why, father might kill you, he is so
wrought up over the doings of the pirates.</p>

<p>DOM. Bah!—That’s a singular locket you have on.</p>

<p>BELLA. Yes, isn’t it? A serpent’s head.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">examining it.</i>) Containing the miniature of a young man.
This is the reason of your quiescence. Will you let me have
this locket?</p>

<p>BELLA. No, I will not.</p>

<p>DOM. And you will not tell me your suitor’s name. Very well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
I swear to you that I will find the man whose picture you
wear.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">laughs.</i>) You cannot. You can only trust me.</p>

<p>BAP. Yes sah. (<i class="dir">begins a nervous, fumbling search.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">behind the mask, in a hollow voice.</i>) Baptiste—(<i class="dir">Baptiste looks up and
as he does so, the hat flies out to him; he yells and exits running; enter Darblee,
angry, just as Dominique comes forth laughing.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Where is he?</p>

<p>DOM. Don’t be angry, uncle. It’s my fault that he didn’t obey
you. You haven’t any time for anger any way. Isn’t
Bella pretty?</p>

<p>DAR. Very. Tell me about Lafitte.</p>

<p>DOM. Eyes like stormy skies. A word, a question, and all along
the cloud of eye-lashes, a lightning flash of challenge!</p>

<p>DAR. So intolerant?</p>

<p>DOM. So right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>DAR. But still—</p>

<p>DOM. She has a right to resent suspicion.</p>

<p>DAR. She! I speak of Lafitte.</p>

<p>DOM. Your pardon. I spoke of Bella.</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">coaxingly.</i>) Lafitte—</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">lapsing into seriousness.</i>) I’ll tell you an impression I received
more clearly than ever during this last voyage. I think Lafitte
is looking for somebody—that he has some implacable
purpose—and that when he finds the person or persons he
seeks, there will be a relentless day of reckoning for all.</p>

<p>DAR. You think so?</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">nods his head.</i>) All along the coasts of Spain and France he
would take his dog and be gone for days together.</p>

<p>DAR. But that—</p>

<p>DOM. May mean nothing. I think differently. (<i class="dir">looking at his watch.</i>)
Heavens! I shall not be able to see my future father-in-law
to-day. I must rejoin my ship.</p>

<p>DAR. You will be back to dinner?</p>

<p>DOM. Yes. <i>Au revoir.</i> (<i class="dir">exeunt; Bella enters just as Duval, Pedro and
the others enter.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">in high feather.</i>) Well, that’s done!</p>

<p>1st LEG. And well done. The petition cannot fail to carry weight.</p>

<p>DUV. Five hundred dollars reward for Lafitte’s head should bring
about results.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">advancing timidly.</i>) It is blood money.</p>

<p>DUV. What of it?</p>

<p>BELLA. Pirates are men.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">smilingly and yet on the alert.</i>) Does Miss Bella know any of them?</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">angrily, to Bella.</i>) I will tell you this much: that if ever the nosing
Britishers get into New Orleans, it will be by the aid of
the pirates. This is no time to compromise with banditti.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">indulgently, protectingly and probingly.</i>) Miss Bella spoke in ignorance.
She can have no sympathy for pirates. (<i class="dir">Duval and others
discuss in pantomime at back.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">impulsively.</i>) She can have—</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">in Bella’s pause; watchfully.</i>) A lover. (<i class="dir">bows.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">recovering herself; trivially.</i>) A lover! I promised myself
many before I left school. Have you ever been in love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Mr. d’Acosta?</p>

<p>PED. Cruel one!</p>

<p>BELLA. Have you any woman relative whom you remember
and love?</p>

<p>PED. Yes. I have an only sister whom I love and who is very
devoted to me.</p>

<p>BELLA. Here?</p>

<p>PED. Yes: but immediately upon the arrival of our family here,
she entered a convent and is now on the point of taking the
veil.</p>

<p>BELLA. Oh, why?</p>

<p>PED. An obstacle in love.</p>

<p>BELLA. Did you try to help her?</p>

<p>PED. I did all I could towards forwarding her marriage.</p>

<p>BELLA. I’d like to know her.</p>

<p>PED. I fear you cannot. She will only see her uncle and myself.</p>

<p>BELLA. Poor girl!—Father is going. (<i class="dir">exeunt; enter Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">looking after Pedro angrily.</i>) Confound it! Unconcerned about
me now altogether,—has richer prospects in view.—I knew
she wouldn’t get tired of it. Instead she’s going to take the
veil. Curse me for a fool! Fortune played in my hands directly
six years ago and I was soft-hearted and squeamish
enough to be melted by a pair of pleading eyes and a half
promise of yes, if Ferdinand should succeed. (<i class="dir">rings bell.</i>) I’ll
have the Marquis, at all events, safely out of the way.
(<i class="dir">enter Darblee.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Good morning, Don Manuel.</p>

<p>MAN. Good morning. I wish to engage a room for a business
meeting between Lafitte and the Spanish merchants.</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">eagerly; curiously.</i>) You know?—</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">sternly.</i>) To-day, at two o’clock.</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">relapsing into business.</i>) The best?</p>

<p>MAN. Certainly.</p>

<p>DAR. It shall be ready. (<i class="dir">exit.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. The Spanish merchants lost no time in instructing me to engage
a room when they received word that Lafitte would
see them at last, and listen to their plea for compromise. It
doesn’t matter that I sent the message. And the Marquis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
who isn’t a merchant, is as excited as any of them, because
of his friends. He’ll attend the meeting, no fear, and I shall
have put that much more time between him and any message
from the convent.—Confound it all, why doesn’t that fellow
come? (<i class="dir">enter a stranger.</i>) Ah, I was just beginning to think you
late.</p>

<p>STRAN. I could only get this. (<i class="dir">showing a rusty priest’s robe.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. So much the better. You’ll look more genuine in rusty
clothes. A priest should be economical. Now you understand
that you are to ask for Miss d’Acosta; that you are sent
to bring her to the bed-side of her dying uncle.</p>

<p>STRAN. I understand all.</p>

<p>MAN. Once out of the convent, you will drive to the little green
cottage immediately above the city, near the Jesuit plantation,
where I will meet you.</p>

<p>STRAN. Very well.</p>

<p>MAN. Be about <i>it</i> now. (<i class="dir">exeunt severally; almost immediately, re-enter
Stranger.</i>)</p>

<p>STRAN. It’s very well and good to say be about it, but I need a
few drinks to brace me up. (<i class="dir">rings bell; enter Darblee.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Good-morning.</p>

<p>STRAN. Let me have a good drink of whiskey. (<i class="dir">Darblee pours out a
drink; Stranger drains it; experiments with his spine to see if he’s braced; looks
gloomy.</i>) Let me have a good drink of whiskey.</p>

<p>DAR. You’ve just had one.</p>

<p>STRAN. Let me have a good drink of whiskey.</p>

<p>DAR. When you’ve paid for the first.</p>

<p>STRAN. Paid! Don Manuel d’Acosta authorizes my demand.
(<i class="dir">Darblee shakes his head.</i>) What’s more, I’m a priest.—Don’t you
believe me? (<i class="dir">enter two roysterers.</i>) Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Here’s a state of affairs. I call upon you to compel this <i>bourgeois</i>
to respect the credit of gentlemen,—to serve us drinks
and as many as we want!</p>

<p>1st ROY. Drinks!</p>

<p>2nd ROY. Come, host. Drinks!</p>

<p>DAR. I do not dispense them for the pleasure of beholding inebriates.</p>

<p>1st ROY. What!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>2nd ROY. Inebriates!</p>

<p>STRAN. Down with him! (<i class="dir">they set upon Darblee and throw him.</i>)</p>

<p>1st ROY. We’ll show you who’s an inebriate. Hold him! (<i class="dir">1st Roysterer
seizes a bottle; Stranger and 2nd Roysterer fasten themselves on Darblee’s
arms; 1st Roysterer puts bottle to Darblee’s face.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. By heaven, he’ll punch my eye out!</p>

<p>1st ROY. (<i class="dir">wavering in drunkenness.</i>) It’s what I think myself. I can’t
find his damned mouth!</p>

<p>STRAN. Unstop the bottle! (<i class="dir">1st Roysterer unstops the bottle; pours contents
into Darblee’s face, aiming all the time for his mouth. Darblee kicks, sputters
and squirms.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Help! (<i class="dir">enter Lafitte; he knocks the Stranger aside, scatters the Roysterers
and laughingly picks up Darblee.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">laughing.</i>) What is it? A secret society function?</p>

<p>DAR. High noon robbery and assault. That’s what it is;—a demand
for drinks without pay. (<i class="dir">wipes his face.</i>)</p>

<p>2nd ROY. (<i class="dir">to Lafitte.</i>) Who are you?</p>

<p>STRAN. You think because you take us unaware—</p>

<p>LAF. How about now? (<i class="dir">draws; exeunt Roysterers.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">pointing to Stranger and laying a cautious hand on Lafitte’s arm.</i>) He’s a
priest.</p>

<p>LAF. Then he should be attending to his business rather than
brawling about drinks. (<i class="dir">Stranger turns off swaggeringly and exits, singing
Mon Coeur a Toi; Lafitte starts; turns to Darblee.</i>) A priest, did you
say?—Then he’d some excuse for wanting drinks. He has
no love to keep his heart warm, no hate to make it hot. I’ll
pay for the drinks. (<i class="dir">goes to door; calls.</i>) Friend! (<i class="dir">signs to Stranger
to return; enter Stranger.</i>) It is a chilly day. Will you have a
drink with us? (<i class="dir">Stranger bows awkwardly.</i>) Come host, your best.
(<i class="dir">laying money on table.</i>) Is it long since you joined the priesthood?
(<i class="dir">they drink.</i>)</p>

<p>STRAN. (<i class="dir">nervously; gloomily.</i>) Not very. (<i class="dir">holding out his glass.</i>) Let me
have a good drink of whiskey. (<i class="dir">Lafitte lays money on table; Darblee
pours out a drink.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Have you far to go to-day?</p>

<p>STRAN. (<i class="dir">tipsily</i>.) To the little green cottage immediately above the
city. Let me have a good drink of whiskey. (<i class="dir">Lafitte lays money
on table; Darblee pours out drink and exits.</i>) I must be going.</p>

<p>LAF. Do you walk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>STRAN. No, sir! Drive. Come (<i class="dir">hic</i>) with me?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">laughing.</i>) To the little green cottage?</p>

<p>STRAN. Near the Jesuit plantation. I (<i class="dir">hic</i>) remember.</p>

<p>LAF. I congratulate you. Good luck.</p>

<p>STRAN. (<i class="dir">going.</i>) To the little green Jesuit (<i class="dir">hic</i>) immediately above
the plantation city. (<i class="dir">exit; enter Darblee.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">bustling about.</i>) Deplorable that I have such scant time in
which to prepare. (<i class="dir">confidentially and gleefully.</i>) A great man
is to be here in a little while—Jean Lafitte!</p>

<p>LAF. You don’t mean it!</p>

<p>DAR. I do and I can show you no greater appreciation of the service
you rendered me than to ask you to stay and catch a
glimpse of him.</p>

<p>LAF. Thanks.</p>

<p>DAR. I’ll wager you any money that the attacks on American vessels
will cease now.</p>

<p>LAF. Why?</p>

<p>DAR. Because Lafitte has come home; because none of them is
brave enough to cope against him; no, nor all of them put together.</p>

<p>LAF. <i>You</i> are a follower of Lafitte?</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">startled into consciousness.</i>) I? You little know me.
Powerful as Lafitte is and great and flattering as have been
the advances he has made to me, I yet withstand him, humble
though I seem.</p>

<p>LAF. Splendid!</p>

<p>DAR. And here are these royal Spanish merchants. For years
they have been striving to at least compromise with him,
and now to-day, mad with delight because they have at last
received word from him that he will see them!</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Has he sent them that word?</p>

<p>DAR. Don Manuel d’Acosta has just a while ago engaged a room
for the meeting.</p>

<p>LAF. Don Manuel d’Acosta! (<i class="dir">aside</i>) And I looking for them in
Spain!</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">anxiously.</i>) You don’t think Lafitte will disappoint them?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">grimly.</i>) No. I don’t think Lafitte will disappoint them.
When do they expect him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>DAR. To-day at two o’clock. Don Manuel—</p>

<p>LAF. Do you know whether the Marquis d’Acosta live in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>DAR. Yes, he does. A beautiful niece of his—</p>

<p>LAF. Ah!</p>

<p>DAR. Came here with him once long ago.</p>

<p>LAF. Here?</p>

<p>DAR. Right here, in this room.</p>

<p>LAF. Do you know where the Marquis lives?</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">reflectively.</i>) No—I don’t know the number.</p>

<p>LAF. Do you know the street?</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">more reflectively.</i>) No, I don’t, but I believe it must be
somewhere in the Latin quarter.</p>

<p>LAF. Thanks. Good-by. (<i class="dir">exit.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. A singular man, but not sharp enough to catch me napping.
(<i class="dir">enter several Spanish merchants.</i>)</p>

<p>1st MER. It is long before the hour. (<i class="dir">looks at his watch.</i>)</p>

<p>2nd MER. What of it? There are many things to discuss. (<i class="dir">enter
Marquis d’Acosta and several merchants.</i>)</p>

<p>MARQ. What, here already!</p>

<p>3d MER. Your watch is slow.</p>

<p>MARQ. (<i class="dir">he and all look at their watches.</i>) Half past one.</p>

<p>2nd MER. Twenty-five to two.</p>

<p>1st MER. We Spanish merchants have been so particularly warred
upon that I had despaired of our ever getting at this man.</p>

<p>3d MER. My dear fellow, never despair. Show us the way, Darblee.
(<i class="dir">exeunt; led by Darblee; enter Mariana and several
nuns.</i>)</p>

<p>MOTHER AUGUSTUS. Is this the place?</p>

<p>MAR. Yes. (<i class="dir">Mother Augustus motions to a man who rings the bell.</i>)</p>

<p>M. AUG. (<i class="dir">to Mariana.</i>) You should give up that silver ring, Mariana,
which seems to be so associated with worldly souvenirs.</p>

<p>MAR. This ring! Never. It is an amulet. At sight of it all faith
is imperative, all beauty understood, all despondency a sin.
(<i class="dir">aside.</i>) What is death? He loves me still. (<i class="dir">enter Baptiste.</i>)</p>

<p>M. AUG. Is the Marquis d’Acosta here?</p>

<p>BAP. Yes ma’am.</p>

<p>M. AUG. Say to him that Miss d’Acosta is here and wishes to see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>BAP. Yes ma’am. (<i class="dir">bows and exit.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">to 1st Nun.</i>) Will the preliminary of my taking the veil be
at all binding?</p>

<p>1st NUN. No.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">earnestly and candidly.</i>) I wish to remain with you, but
my heart is not and can never be indifferent to the joys and
hopes that made life dearest.</p>

<p>1st NUN. It need not be.</p>

<p>M. AUG. She should strive to make it so.</p>

<p>1st NUN. She is going to France, mother, where her young girlhood
was spent. (<i class="dir">Mother Augustus turns away.</i>)</p>

<p>2d NUN. What a singular mask over that door!</p>

<p>MAR. I know all about that mask. I can’t explain the uncontrollable
impulse that made me beg to know all about it and its
hiding-place. Mr. Darblee finally, out of sheer courtesy,
told me the secret, though up to that time no one but he and
a nephew of his knew that there was a hiding-place connected
with the mask at all.</p>

<p>1st NUN. How is it?</p>

<p>MAR. It seems very simple. The door beneath the mask is a
sham one, the floor in the passage-way is high enough to permit
one to look through the mask standing and a touch on a
certain part of it opens a secret slide in the wall; an otherwise
undiscoverable, impregnable hiding-place. It’s delightfully
tricky! See. (<i class="dir">she goes laughingly by a side door to the
back of a door beneath the mask and looks through it.</i>)</p>

<p>M. AUG. Mariana! Come down. (<i class="dir">enter Mariana.</i>) You should
be ashamed of yourself to be such a child.</p>

<p>MAR. I can tell you the story of the mask. It is the mask of a
dead pirate’s head. He was killed long ago for some atrocity
or other and his mask placed in this room by the Governor’s
order as a warning to the pirates who were in the habit of
congregating in this place. The superstition obtained that
when any of the pirates are in danger the spirit of the murdered
man sends some human ear into his mask to baffle the
plotters.</p>

<p>3d NUN. Is that believed now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>MAR. Yes, by many. A generation or two ago, however, the
house passed into the hands of Mr. Darblee’s father, who of
course, made it orderly and respectable. He had an addition
built and being possessed by love of the mysterious and unexpected,
had the secret slide put in the wall.</p>

<p>2d NUN. It sounds like some of the stories about Lafitte?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">shuddering.</i>) Ah, not that name! I have a dread of that
man.</p>

<p>1st NUN. They say that he is terrible, but that he has always the
honor of his word.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">with sweeping contempt.</i>) The honor of his word! A thief
honorable! A leader in lawlessness, cruelty, shamelessness!</p>

<p>3d NUN. I hope we may be spared.</p>

<p>2d NUN. Oh, the pirates! There are no safeguards against the
dangers that beset an ocean voyage.</p>

<p>M. AUG. There is one safeguard all sufficient,—the Almighty.
(<i class="dir">enter Marquis.</i>)</p>

<p>MARQ. Mariana,—your pardon, ladies, for having kept you waiting,
but the occasion admitted of no neglect.</p>

<p>M. AUG. We have just come from your house where they told us
you were here. We have been notified that our ship sails almost
immediately. Mariana will barely have time to take the
veil.</p>

<p>MARQ. As trustee of her fortune, I have decided to see it safely
with her in France,—the two chests; one of gold and one of
jewels.</p>

<p>MAR. Oh, thank you, uncle for coming with us! Is Pedro here?</p>

<p>MARQ. No, he is not.</p>

<p>MAR. I so wished to tell him good-by. (<i class="dir">enter Manuel, baffled, enraged,
desperate.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Mariana!</p>

<p>MAR. Mother Augustus, my cousin, Don d’Acosta. (<i class="dir">Manuel bows.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. How happens it that you are leaving so soon?</p>

<p>MAR. That the Captain knows better than I do.</p>

<p>MAN. There has been no sudden good wind that he should thus
hasten the time for sailing by twenty-four hours. (<i class="dir">breaking
from his angry sense of defeat into wild pleading.</i>) And you?...
Don’t go Mariana. Is there nothing I can say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>MAR. Yes. Tell me about Pedro.</p>

<p>MAN. I have no time for Pedro,—for anyone but yourself and myself.
(<i class="dir">enter Pedro.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. There he is now! Pedro. (<i class="dir">goes to him.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">suave; affectionate; regretful.</i>) Well,—is it good-by?</p>

<p>MAR. You’ll come to see me sometime.</p>

<p>PED. When I acquire means enough to travel on.</p>

<p>MAR. Oh, I wish—</p>

<p>M. AUG. We must be leaving.</p>

<p>MAR. Come to the Church, Pedro,—just across the way—and see
me take the veil.</p>

<p>PED. I’ll be there. <i>Au revoir.</i> (<i class="dir">the Marquis, the nuns and Mariana
exeunt; Pedro looks at Manuel who has sunk desperately
into a chair goes up to him and slaps him on the back.</i>)
Brace up, old man!</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">intolerably; shaking Pedro’s hand off.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>PED. If you were not so huffy, I’d tell you a secret.</p>

<p>MAN. You are married, I suppose.</p>

<p>PED. Far from it,—and cannot be without your services.</p>

<p>MAN. Tell me the secret.</p>

<p>PED. I have a plan by which I can get command of a pirate ship at
a moment’s notice. There is one now, the Creole, lying at
anchor, ready to sail at a word of command. (<i class="dir">they look at
each other, then Pedro offers his hand; Manuel takes it.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">rings bell.</i>) I’ll join you immediately. (<i class="dir">exit Pedro; enter
Darblee.</i>) Has Lafitte come yet?</p>

<p>DAR. He has not.</p>

<p>MAN. I’ll be back in a moment.</p>

<p>DAR. Very well. (<i class="dir">exeunt severally; enter Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. No trace of the house. (<i class="dir">re-enter Darblee.</i>) Is Don Manuel
d’Acosta here?</p>

<p>DAR. He has gone, but he will be back immediately. (<i class="dir">music heard;

<p>LAF. What is that music?</p>

<p>DAR. Some ceremony in the Church, I suppose. (<i class="dir">Lafitte walks to

be disappointed in seeing Lafitte. (<i class="dir">looking at his watch.</i>) He’s
late.</p>

<p>LAF. And Don Manuel?</p>

<p>DAR. Has not yet returned.—I suppose Lafitte will be here though.
I never could understand that long absence of his. It must
have due to a love affair.</p>

<p>LAF. You’d better keep a quiet tongue. Lafitte is not a man to
endure prying into his private affairs.</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">laughs.</i>) One would think I need instructions. (<i class="dir">enter Baptiste.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Do you know Lafitte?</p>

<p>DAR. Intimately. Many a time he has begged me to go with him.
“Darblee,” he would, “I need you.”</p>

<p>LAF. You would make my dog blush.</p>

<p>DAR. Many a time, in this very room, with tears in his eyes, he
has upbraided me for my obduracy.</p>

<p>BAP. Dat ee have, sah!</p>

<p>DAR. <i>I</i> am not afraid of Lafitte. I will tell him to his face that he
can’t overawe me.</p>

<p>BAP. ’Deed ee cyarnt. Pesky what trash! (<i class="dir">enter Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. Lafitte—</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">In consternation.</i>) What!</p>

<p>BAP. (<i class="dir">staggered.</i>) Lordy!</p>

<p>BEL. I have a suspicion that the Creole is going to attack the
American vessel which sailed a little while ago.</p>

<p>LAF. Where is the Creole?</p>

<p>BEL. She’s just cleared the wharf. (<i class="dir">Darblee ostentatiously brings a chair
up behind Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">looking at his watch.</i>) How much start have they on us?</p>

<p>BEL. Enough to count very seriously. There is a storm coming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
too. The wind will shift in less than three hours. (<i class="dir">Baptiste is
bringing a chair for Beluche when Darblee intercepts him, takes the chair from

<p>DAR. Get out! (<i class="dir">looking after him angrily.</i>) Son of Satan! (<i class="dir">exit Baptiste;
Darblee ostentatiously brings chair up behind Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. There is no time to lose. Come.</p>

<p>BEL. It is a question whether the chances justify pursuit.</p>

<p>LAF. What!</p>

<p>BEL. The Pride is at Barataria.</p>

<p>LAF. What of it? Is not an American vessel in danger? Shall I
not accept a challenge from my own men? (<i class="dir">exit, followed by
Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>FATH. P. (<i class="dir">a short, rubicund priest.</i>) He is not now. Sea-sickness is
all imagination. I have never been sea-sick.</p>

<p>1st M. P. (<i class="dir">sea-sick.</i>) You never sailed such a deadly level sea.</p>

<p>1st L. P. That’s the delightful part of it.</p>

<p>1st M. P. Ugh! (<i class="dir">enter Marquis.</i>)</p>

<p>MARQ. They say there’s a storm coming.</p>

<p>FATH. P. You should have no patience with fear.</p>

you hear?</p>

<p>FATH. P. Nothing—but swearing.</p>

<p>CAPT. Just so. Those men are old sailors. Would they be
swearing if there were any danger?</p>

<p>FATH. P. (<i class="dir">grasping Captain’s hand.</i>) Thank you. (<i class="dir">exeunt; enter two ship’s

<p>1st PIR. Will you put it on my neck? (<i class="dir">he bends his head and Mariana

have a jewel, I may have a look at her face. I’ll bet you it’s

sea!—save him!</p>

<p>MAN. We will hope that he can swim to safety, dear.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">stupified</i>). What!</p>

<p>MAN. I dare not interfere. I discovered that the pirates intended
attacking the vessel and in order to save you, took a false
oath and joined them. Any rebellion would cost me my life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
But life or no life, I will interfere in your behalf.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">distractedly.</i>) Uncle,—</p>

<p>MAN. Listen to me, Mariana. Your uncle must take his chances.
But you—You have no chance of death. You will be taken
to Barataria, there to become a drudge when your attractions
as toy shall have palled. Let me try to save you. Marry
me, I beseech you.</p>

<p>MAR. Why can you not save me without marrying me?</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">doggedly.</i>) Because I have not the incentive; because I
will not love you longer without reward.</p>

<p>MAR. I scorn your help. Any pirate would do as much.</p>

<p>MAN. Without marrying you.</p>

<p>MAR. I will appeal to them; they cannot be utterly heartless.</p>

<p>MAN. They seemed so about the Marquis. Ah, Mariana, listen to
reason. Just now when you taunted me, I was angry. But
I will tell you now why I cannot save you without marrying
you. Because I have not the right to protect you from them;
because now you belong as much to them as to me. (<i class="dir">enter
several tipsy pirates.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. I tell you that part of the booty belongs to me.</p>

<p>2d PIR. I don’t care a straw about that. The booty I want is her
money. (<i class="dir">exeunt pirates.</i>)</p>

honorable to choose dishonor now. I will wait for your love;

<p>1st PIR. (<i class="dir">to a pirate coming from the opposite direction.</i>) You’d better

Three! (<i class="dir">the three appointed by lot go to back of stage; Beluche

<p>BEL. One, (<i class="dir">they raise their guns.</i>) two. (<i class="dir">enter Father Cuthbert.</i>)</p>

<p>FATH. C. Pedro!—Stop! (<i class="dir">to the men.</i>) Would you send a
soul into eternity without preparation? Leave us. I will be
responsible for the prisoner.</p>

<p>BEL. He may escape.</p>

<p>FATH. C. He is bound. I will call you when he shall have confessed.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">motions the men away; to Father Cuthbert, reluctantly.</i>) Ten
minutes. (<i class="dir">the men stack their guns against a tree and exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p>FATH. C. (<i class="dir">turning to Pedro.</i>) Quickly. What have you done?</p>

<p>PED. I was tempted and fell. I got command of a pirate ship and
attacked and sank an American vessel.</p>

<p>FATH. C. (<i class="dir">overwhelmed.</i>) Miserable man!</p>

<p>PED. There is no hope, you see.</p>

<p>FATH. C. No. Lafitte himself, could not have one rule for his
men and another for outsiders. But you—Mariana’s
brother!</p>

<p>PED. He does not know that I am Mariana’s brother. Once, in
Bayonne, unperceived by him, I saw my sister’s lover, but I
had no idea that Lafitte was the long-mourned-for man.</p>

<p>FATH. C. He does not know that you are Mariana’s brother!</p>

<p>PED. No. In view of my coming execution I have spared him the
knowledge.</p>

<p>FATH. C. (<i class="dir">walking about</i>) It must not be. It would be an eternal
barrier between them. Yet—how? How useless to appeal
for extra time to the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>PED. I could make some amends by sending you word of Mariana.</p>

<p>FATH. C. Yes.—I must risk it. (<i class="dir">looks off to see that he is unwatched;
goes to the three guns, unloads them, still leaving them
powder-charged and returns them to their places; speaks to Pedro.</i>)
You will feign death upon being fired at. (<i class="dir">Pedro nods.</i>) And
now, my poor boy, a prayer. (<i class="dir">Pedro bows his head.</i>) Merciful
Lord of death and life, (<i class="dir">pirates return; take up their guns.</i>)

Save him, forgive him, God, dear Mother!</p>

silently.</i>) Two! (<i class="dir">enter Mariana; she wears a long, trailing
white dress and her hair is loosely twisted.</i>) Three! (<i class="dir">men fire;

<p>FATH. C. Gentlemen, I beg a great favor of you;—that the prisoner’s
body be left in my charge.</p>

<p>BEL. His head should be stuck up on a pole for buzzards to pick at!
(<i class="dir">knocks the body contemptuously with his gun; Father Cuthbert
puts out his hand deprecatingly.</i>)</p>

<p>PIRATES. Ah!</p>

<p>FATH. C. I knew this man long ago,—and the law is now satisfied.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">reluctantly.</i>) Well,—out of respect for you.</p>

<p>FATH. C. Thank you. (<i class="dir">bows; kneels beside the body; the men

had found on Pedro and thrown aside; he puts it in his coat

that they have all gone, takes from the ground a long, hooded
overcoat which he had carried over his arm when he entered;
touches Pedro who rises.</i>) Put this on, (<i class="dir">Pedro puts on overcoat.</i>)
and make the most of your chances. (<i class="dir">Father Cuthbert pulls
the hood over Pedro’s face.</i>) Fortunately it is a new coat
they have never seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>PED. You have saved my life.</p>

<p>FATH. C. Go. Don’t forget about Mariana. (<i class="dir">Pedro nods; exit.</i>) God
help him! (<i class="dir">he goes to the grave, takes up a spade and fills in the grave
quickly; enter Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">suspiciously.</i>) You’ve made short work of it. Why didn’t you
call in one of the men to help you?</p>

<p>FATH. C. (<i class="dir">fixing the earth.</i>) Sentiment, I suppose.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">poking the newly broken ground with his stick.</i>) The earth is very
sweet and clean for such as this.</p>

How is the young lady, Lizbette?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">startled.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>MAN. I beg your forgiveness for my words and conduct on the

taken from me—taken to worse than death. I risked my life—I
risk it now to save you.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">with transcendent happiness.</i>) There is no need. Jean is

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">turning upon him.</i>) Take care.</p>

<p>MAN. His name is not Jean Durand, but Jean Lafitte! (<i class="dir">Mariana

<p>1st PIR. (<i class="dir">points to a boat coming up the bay.</i>) That’s a strange boat

<p>CAPT. L. And here (<i class="dir">handing Lafitte another paper.</i>) are instructions
to me by Sir W. H. Percy, Captain of the Hermes, senior
officer in the Gulf of Mexico. (<i class="dir">pirates dress the table with viands and
wine.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">reads.</i>)—“lands will at the conclusion of the war be alloted
to them in His Majesty’s colonies in America”—</p>

<p>CAPT. L. And in addition, as you will see, thirty thousand dollars
conferred upon you, payable at your option in Pensacola or
New Orleans.</p>

<p>C. McW. You surely cannot let slip such an opportunity of acquiring
fortune and consideration.</p>

<p>LAF. In a day or two—</p>

<p>CAPT. L. No reflection should be necessary. As a Frenchman,
you are now of course, a friend of Great Britain.</p>

<p>LAF. And as an American?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>CAPT. L. You are outlawed the American Government and exposed,
if taken, to infamy and death.</p>

<p>C. McW. Whereas in the British service you would have respect,
an enviable prospect of promotion,—</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">leading the way to the table.</i>) Let us sit.</p>

<p>C. McW. (<i class="dir">they seat themselves.</i>) And proper appreciation.</p>

<p>CAPT. L. Your services would be immensely important in carrying
out the operations which the British government has
planned against lower Louisiana.</p>

<p>LAF. How so?</p>

<p>CAPT. L. Your knowledge of the country would serve us unerringly,
(<i class="dir">enter at back Manuel, who beckons cautiously; enter
Mariana.</i>) Then, so soon as possession of Louisiana is obtained,
the army will penetrate into the upper country and
act in concert with the forces in Canada. Everything is prepared
for carrying on the war in that quarter with the utmost
vigor.</p>

<p>LAF. You are confident of success?</p>

<p>C. McW. We are sure of it. The French and Spanish population
of Louisiana will support us.</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">reflectively.</i>) The negroes, too.</p>

<p>CAPT. L. Will render us great assistance, because we will incite
them to insurrection by offering them their liberty.</p>

<p>C. McW. Come. What do you say?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">rising, glass in hand.</i>) I drink—</p>

<p>CAPT. L. Lafitte forever! He drinks to His Majesty, King George
the Third!</p>

<p>LAF. I drink to—Success!</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">bows.</i>) Good-night.</p>

<p>MAR. Good-night. (<i class="dir">exit Manuel; enter Governor Claiborne.</i>)</p>

<p>GOV. C. (<i class="dir">soliloquizing.</i>) Impatience does no good....</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">advances; bows.</i>) Governor Claiborne.</p>

<p>GOV. C. I beg your pardon, but—</p>

<p>MAR. Don’t you remember me? At the convent—</p>

<p>GOV. C. So I do. Miss d’Acosta.</p>

<p>MAR. Yes, Mariana d’Acosta, come to ask you a great favor.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Anything in my power.</p>

<p>MAR. I have heard of the delayed expedition against Barataria. I
will myself, if you will allow me, lead it.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Miss d’Acosta!</p>

<p>MAR. No one is so well qualified for the work as I. I have lived
there, days that have been years. I have seen them rob,
destroy life and property; kill my nearest and dearest.
Oh!—</p>

<p>GOV. C. My poor child!</p>

<p>MAR. I will lead the expedition. I know the way. (<i class="dir">Governor
Claiborne shakes his head; walks back and forth.</i>) I have seen
the British in consultation with those pirates; seen them
seated at the same table in feasting and good fellowship!</p>

<p>GOV. C. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Can you be sure?</p>

<p>MAR. I heard them discussing the capture of Louisiana; I heard and
saw them drink to Success!</p>

<p>GOV. C. (<i class="dir">walks about.</i>) If it were not for your youth—your
sex—</p>

<p>MAR. Ah, let me go. I have most cause to go.</p>

<p>GOV. C. You were on the ship—</p>

<p>MAR. Yes. Let me go.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Your brother—</p>

<p>MAR. Ah, there is no time to lose. Action is imperative. Write
the order.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Pray heaven, I do not wrong you in doing so. (<i class="dir">writes;
Mariana takes the order.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>MAR. The nation will bless you for this act. (<i class="dir">exeunt; Mariana
hurriedly, Governor Claiborne slowly and much perturbed in
spirit; enter from opposite direction, Pedro; enter Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) You! Why, I thought—Does Mariana know
you are alive?</p>

<p>PED. Probably not.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">with sudden change of thought; hurriedly, eagerly.</i>) Would
you like to earn the five hundred dollars reward for Lafitte’s
head?</p>

<p>PED. I would.</p>

<p>MAN. Very well. (<i class="dir">takes Mariana’s note out of his pocket.</i>) Here’s
an easy way.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">reads.</i>) “Dear Father:—I beg your pardon for my words
and actions at Barataria. I shall be at <i>l’hotel des Exiles</i> at 4
o’clock on the 7th. May I see you then? Humbly and in
sorrow, Mariana.”—(<i class="dir">slaps Manuel on the back.</i>) My boy,
love is improving you.</p>

<p>MAN. Have you an eraser?</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">takes one out of his pocket.</i>) Always prudent to carry one.
(<i class="dir">Manuel spreads Mariana’s note on a table; erases heading.</i>) I
think I can capture Emperor Lafitte at the time and place mentioned
and make beside quite a handsome sum off the Spanish
merchants for the capture.</p>

<p>MAN. By whom can we send this?</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">examining the note.</i>) It must go immediately. The appointment
is only two days off and Lafitte cannot be trusted to be
found at the last moment. He is said to be frequently away
from Barataria for days.</p>

<p>MAN. How about that nigger of Darblee? He is thought to be very
much <i>en rapport</i> with Lizbette, the old witch of the island,
who is Lafitte’s staunch friend.</p>

<p>PED. Just the man! Frighten him sufficiently with portents and
he would as soon think of dying as of proving faithless.
(<i class="dir">enter Baptiste at back.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Isn’t that he?</p>

<p>PED. Baptiste. (<i class="dir">Baptiste starts; comes forward bowing.</i>) You are
in great danger.</p>

<p>BAP. Yes, sah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>PED. It behooves you to be careful.—Do you know Lizbette?</p>

<p>BAP. Naw, sah, I ain’t—</p>

<p>PED. That will do. Do you know Lizbette?</p>

<p>BAP. (<i class="dir">in distressed irresolution.</i>) I done had some ’quaintance wid
’er, but—</p>

<p>PED. Here is a paper that you will give to Lizbette for Lafitte.
Now listen. If it reach him safely and in time, you will have
a big reward. If not—</p>

<p>BAP. Lordy!</p>

<p>PED. If not, you will be haunted to a most torturing death; a death
you will not be able to escape. You are in great danger. I
put the paper here on this table. (<i class="dir">lays paper down; Baptiste
approaches.</i>) Don’t touch it, till you have seen me disappear.
I’m going. (<i class="dir">moves toward exit.</i>) Be careful. Watch the
paper. Watch me. Your safety is at stake. (<i class="dir">raises his
hand impressively; exeunt Manuel and Pedro; Baptiste in his
eagerness to watch Pedro, goes a little up stage, away from the
table; enter by a side entrance, Lizbette.</i>)</p>

<p>LIZ. (<i class="dir">passing by table and swooping up paper.</i>) I dunno who dat
scatter all dis litter ’bout. (<i class="dir">throws paper in fire and exits without
having been seen by Baptiste.</i>)</p>

<p>BAP. (<i class="dir">comes to table; finds note gone! falls on his knees.</i>) Lordy!
Lordy! (<i class="dir">crawls around table on his knees looking for paper;
enter Bella.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. Why, Baptiste! You’d better hurry home before Mr.
Darblee discovers your absence.</p>

<p>BAP. Good-by, Miss Bella.</p>

<p>BELLA. Good-by, Baptiste. (<i class="dir">exit Baptiste.</i>) Poor fellow! He
looks as I feel. Oh, I am so glad Dominique has not
come. If he and Pedro d’Acosta meet ... I believe that man to
be a sinister and deadly.—I hate State balls! (<i class="dir">enter Dominique.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. Alone?</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">half coquettishly.</i>) I was hoping to be.</p>

<p>DOM. You were waiting for me,—wondering why I hadn’t come.
Now, confess.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">seriously.</i>) I was prayerfully glad you hadn’t come.</p>

<p>DOM. What!—Let me tell you something:—you haven’t kissed
me once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>BELLA. What kept you? (<i class="dir">enter unperceived, Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. I see. You want me to kiss you first. (<i class="dir">kisses her in spite
of Bella’s attempted defense; Manuel coughs; Dominique turns;
Manuel exits.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. Now, you see.</p>

<p>DOM. A very disagreeable fellow. Is he the suitor?</p>

<p>BELLA. No.</p>

<p>DOM. Who is the suitor, Bella? What’s his abominable name?
(<i class="dir">Bella is silent.</i>) Is he here? (<i class="dir">Bella starts.</i>) He is. Then
I’ll find him. (<i class="dir">going.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">alarmed.</i>) Dominique! I’ll tell you one thing about
him. He’s—stout.</p>

<p>DOM. What! Ah, you are joking. I give you warning. I am
going to disguise myself and catch a glimpse of that man.</p>

<p>BELLA. Why disguise yourself?</p>

<p>DOM. Because I believe you’d warn him away if you knew I were
coming.</p>

<p>BELLA. Pshaw! (<i class="dir">laughs.</i>) I’d know you under any disguise.
Oh!—I have an idea. “Things will come right through a
disguise!”</p>

<p>DOM. Eh?</p>

<p>BELLA. You must assume a disguise and try it on your uncle.</p>

<p>DOM. My uncle!</p>

<p>BELLA. Don’t you see, if the impression produced by it be favorable,
you can try it on my father and lay your case before
him. Then in an adverse event, you’ll still be unknown.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">doubtfully, scratching his chin.</i>) Ye—es; but I’d like to
catch a glimpse of Mr. Duval to-night.</p>

<p>BELLA. He has already gone home. Now listen, Dominique.
Don’t be seen with me any more to-night. We’ll only
jeopardize our chances.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">kicks a flower lying on the floor.</i>) Allow me to conduct you
to your friends. (<i class="dir">Bella takes his arms and as they turn to move
away, Pedro enters and sees them; exeunt Bella and Dominique.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">savagely, yet calculatingly.</i>) There is a way ... it
may not be worth much, but then again it may. (<i class="dir">re-enter
Dominique alone; as he is passing, Pedro goes up to him; raises
his hand.</i>) “TO-MORROW—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>DOM. “AND HER DUPES.”</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">offers Dominique his hand; gives him a hearty shake.</i>) At
eleven o’clock on the morning of the 7th, you are to go to the
<i>Cafe Marin</i> for an important paper containing news of urgent
import for Lafitte. At three o’clock of the same day, you are
to bring the documents to Lafitte at <i>l’hotel des Exiles</i>.</p>

<p>DOM. At three o’clock.</p>

<p>PED. I am understood?</p>

<p>DOM. Perfectly. <i>Au revoir.</i> (<i class="dir">exit; enter Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Just a word. You’d better make yourself secure with your
lady-love. Otherwise, you may find that even with one fortune,
you will be unable to get the other.</p>

<p>PED. What do you mean?</p>

<p>MAN. I noticed a very ardent young man with her a while ago,
and I noticed that he kissed her quite possessingly.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">grimly.</i>) I have the young man under <i>surveillance</i>. (<i class="dir">enter
unperceived, Lizbette; she straightens a rug; Dominique repasses
at back with a few ladies.</i>) Is that the man? (<i class="dir">Manuel
and Lizbette look up stage.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. That’s the man.</p>

<p>PED. My stay in Barataria wasn’t profitless after all. I learned
the pirate pass-word. (<i class="dir">Lizbette, who had been on the point of
going, stops; listens.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Not much gain in that, I should say.</p>

<p>PED. Well, I used it a while ago as an experiment upon that ardent
young man and the trap succeeded beautifully. He answered
immediately.</p>

<p>MAN. Why didn’t you have him arrested?</p>

<p>PED. I had no witnesses. But I have instructed him to get and
bring certain papers to Lafitte at Darblee’s at 3 o’clock on
the afternoon of the 7th. I shall have a body of armed men
on the spot and if the government fail to catch and convict
the fellow with those papers on him, I shall be much deceived.
(<i class="dir">exeunt Pedro and Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>LIZ. (<i class="dir">advances; shakes her fist after them.</i>) Catch Marser Dominique,
would you? Not wid de powers ’gainst yo. <i>I</i> kin

<p>LAF. Is Miss d’Acosta here?</p>

<p>SER. Naw, sah.</p>

<p>LAF. Be careful. She has been here.</p>

<p>SER. (<i class="dir">scratching his temple.</i>) Miss d’Acosta?—Oh, yes sah; I ’members.</p>

<p>LAF. Is she here now.</p>

<p>SER. Less’n she done gone, sah. She was hyar a minit ago. (<i class="dir">Lafitte
exits eagerly followed by servant; enter Governor Claiborne
and the Chairman on the Committee of War Measures.</i>)</p>

<p>GOV. C. I was very reluctant to let her go.</p>

<p>CHAIR. If Lafitte be in league with the British, it is a league formidable
beyond computation.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Exactly. No time can be lost. I ordered the expedition
off with all speed. Lafitte must be captured. Since the five
hundred dollars reward be of no avail, we’ll try fire.</p>

<p>CHAIR. It is like the British to league themselves with those hellish
pirates. (<i class="dir">exeunt; enter Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. She is not here and I can find no clue as to where she has
gone. (<i class="dir">leans against mantel; enter several ladies and gentlemen.</i>)</p>

<p>1st LADY. She must have reconsidered her determination to become
a nun.</p>

<p>2d LADY. No wonder! I think Don Manuel d’Acosta (<i class="dir">Lafitte
starts</i>) is the most perfectly fascinating man I ever met.</p>

<p>1st GEN. Oh, now. A little quarter!</p>

<p>1st LADY. He seemed so tender to her—so protecting and gallant!
(<i class="dir">exeunt ladies and gentlemen.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. I must find her, or she will be duped, trapped, as she was
trapped into a belief that I could be a traitor! (<i class="dir">enter Governor
Claiborne and the Chairman; Lafitte goes up to them.</i>) Governor
Claiborne, allow me to present to you—Jean Lafitte.
(<i class="dir">bows.</i>)</p>

<p>GOV. C. What!—Do you know that there is a five hundred dollar
reward for your head posted over this city?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>LAF. I have been a little more flattering. (<i class="dir">bows.</i>) I have
offered five thousand dollars for yours.</p>

<p>GOV. C. (<i class="dir">enraged.</i>) You dare! (<i class="dir">to the Chairman</i>.) The guard.</p>

<p>CHAIR. (<i class="dir">summoning at back quickly.</i>) The guard! (<i class="dir">enter
soldiers.</i>)</p>

<p>GOV. C. I order you to—(<i class="dir">points to Lafitte; Lafitte takes from his
breast a white paper; holds it commandingly aloft; the Governor
pauses; waives the soldiers off.</i>) Await further orders. (<i class="dir">exeunt
soldiers.</i>) Well? It is questionable honor in me to respect
even a flag of truce in your hands.—Proceed.</p>

<p>LAF. The British are preparing to attack New Orleans by way of
Barataria.</p>

<p>GOV. C. Well sir? You are ready to give them assistance.</p>

<p>LAF. I come to offer my services to the American forces.</p>

<p>CHAIR. A trick.</p>

<p>LAF. For no pay whatever;—to enter the lists merely as a private.</p>

<p>CHAIR. A ruse, sir; a crafty ruse by which to obtain money or
honors from the American government. (<i class="dir">Lafitte hands the
paper to Governor Claiborne.</i>)</p>

<p>GOV C. (<i class="dir">reads.</i>)—“Captain!... thirty thousand dollars!”
... (<i class="dir">hands the paper to the Chairman.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. If you will not accept my services, I shall instantly leave the
country. I will not suffer the imputation of having co-operated
towards an invasion from Barataria which cannot fail to take
place. (<i class="dir">Governor Claiborne walks about.</i>)</p>

<p>CHAIR. (<i class="dir">doubtfully still.</i>) The Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate are here—</p>

<p>GOV. C. It would do no harm to see them and find out whether
they think it fit to submit the matter to the Legislature and
to General Jackson.</p>

<p>LAF. I can only give you ten minutes in which to decide.</p>

<p>GOV. C. (<i class="dir">resentfully.</i>) You are autocratic.</p>

<p>LAF. I must be. A matter dearer life, country, heaven, claims my
attention and cannot wait. I will await your early return here.
(<i class="dir">exeunt Governor Claiborne and the Chairman; Lafitte becomes
impatient; looks at his watch; finally sits near the fire and absent-mindedly

<p>BELLA. We’ll wait until he have the fortune.</p>

Come, let us sit here.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) The stout man! (<i class="dir">aside.</i>)</p>

<p>DAR. Baptiste. (<i class="dir">Baptiste falls back in a state of collapse; exit Darblee;

<p>BAP. Naw sah, Marser Duval. De mask sperrit put yo in dyar,

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">nervously.</i>) I just caught a glimpse of a man with a full

and met Mr. Darblee.</p>

<p>DUV. A plague of old pirate houses! They’re always full of traps.</p>

<p>DAR. (<i class="dir">to Baptiste.</i>) Get out! (<i class="dir">to Duval.</i>) I’ll have him severely

<p>DAR. Oh, of course, he won’t be punished.</p>

better. I need a little rest.—If only he had not escaped!...
I wonder (<i class="dir">looking scornfully at mask.</i>) if you are still busy?
Did you send some human ear into your mask to warn your
fellow pirates of the burning of Barataria? (<i class="dir">mockingly.</i>) I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
will listen now. Perhaps you wish me to save them. (<i class="dir">exit to
back of mask; looks through it; enter Duval and Pedro, the latter
out of sight of the mask eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">excitedly.</i>) You had my father murdered!</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">sneeringly.</i>) Did he favor your suit so much that you regret
him? (<i class="dir">Mariana starts; noise in the niche.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. What was that?—(<i class="dir">irritably.</i>) Your interference in my behalf
has been too costly.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">contemptuously and intolerantly.</i>) Did I not take my own
medicine? Was I not very nearly killed in Barataria by Lafitte’s
order? Would I not have been killed but for the fact that
Father Cuthbert unloaded the guns?</p>

<p>MAN. A likely story! You knew from the beginning that Lafitte
was Jean Durand. You depended upon that fact in case of
emergency.</p>

<p>PED. Have a care. No man shall accuse me of being a coward
with impunity.</p>

<p>MAN. I challenge you to deny that you told Lafitte you are Mariana’s
brother.</p>

<p>PED. Certainly, I deny it. Lafitte saw in me only the Colonel Tolosa
who had had him drugged and court-martialed from Napoleon’s
army six years ago. Not that I would not have availed
myself of the chance to escape, if there had been one; but
there is no escape in pirate law for insubordinators. And you
may thank your lucky star that Lafitte did not happen on the
execution ground when Mariana did. It would have been all
up with you if he had.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">with feverish apprehension.</i>) If she should discover our plot!</p>

<p>PED. She is safe never to know it. The men have orders not to
let her in:—small-pox in the house.</p>

<p>MAN. Lafitte’s arrest will be made without her knowledge. But
you—She will hear of you through the reward.</p>

<p>PED. What of it? I cheerfully forego all privileges to her society.
So that she does not hear of your complicity—</p>

<p>MAN. It is prudent to burn that agreement about her fortune. It
will make no difference to you. The chests are in Barataria
and so soon as Lafitte is disposed of, you can go for them.
(<i class="dir">Pedro takes a paper from his pocket and hands it to Manuel;
Manuel opens it; starts.</i>) What!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>PED. What’s the matter?</p>

<p>MAN. Oh, despicable.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">tears the paper out of Manuel’s hand; stamps his foot.</i>) Fool!
Fool!</p>

<p>MAN. Traitor! British spy! And to think that I told you of the
British Commission’s offer to Lafitte!</p>

<p>PED. Damn it all!</p>

<p>MAN. And here (<i class="dir">shaking his hand at the paper.</i>) I discover that
you have offered to show them the way into New Orleans
and earn the British money at the same time that you are
pretending to serve the American Government by capturing
Lafitte.</p>

<p>PED. Ah, have done. I admit that I drew them a careful map of
the country. You have seen the written guarantee of payment
from Captain Lockyer of the British navy in case the
chart be found correct.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">accusingly.</i>) You!</p>

<p>PED. That was the paper I had intended to be found on the ardent
young man. As to Lafitte, I see no reason why I should not
combine pleasure with business.</p>

<p>MAN. As to Lafitte, all right. He ought to be killed—curse him!—will
be, if he come, but your treachery to the government
is intolerable.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">cruelly and deliberately.</i>) Do you threaten, or are you merely
patriotic? (<i class="dir">Manuel walks about.</i>) Because in the former
case, I will see to it that you do not get Mariana, unless—</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">turning on him angrily.</i>) There are two sides to that!
Suppose I inform the Governor that the attack upon and scuttling
of the American vessel, the killing of her captain, my
father and many passengers, the delivery of her crew into
piratical hands were your work? That you forged an order
from Lafitte in order to get command of one of his ships?
Suppose I inform him that the work of rescue was really done
by Lafitte?</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">quietly.</i>) Would you not be implicating yourself? Would
you not be doing Lafitte a good turn?—We had best stand by
our old bargain: the girl for you, the money for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>PED. I haven’t it.</p>

<p>MAN. What!</p>

<p>PED. I made a mistake; left that paper instead of this. (<i class="dir">rapping
paper in his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. What! That man has.... If Mariana should ever see
it....</p>

<p>PED. I can remedy that blunder yet.</p>

<p>MAN. But if for all this, she will not—</p>

<p>PED. Then she must be made to.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">fretfully.</i>) Why she should have chosen a house with entrances
on three streets.... We cannot watch all
three.</p>

<p>PED. Lafitte is not on his guard. I’ll watch the North side, you
the South and the men the West. (<i class="dir">walks apart absorbed in
thought.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">excitedly; restlessly.</i>) At what time did her note tell Father
Cuthbert she would see him? (<i class="dir">takes out a note-book;
opens it.</i>) 4 o’clock. Emperor Lafitte is not yet due for a
long while. (<i class="dir">walks about.</i>) That was a good idea to have her
write that note in pencil ... and a cleverer one to erase
the “dear father” and send it to Lafitte.... (<i class="dir">enter Dominique
disguised; he wears a very red, full beard.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">aside on perceiving Pedro.</i>) The very man! I’ll try him.
(<i class="dir">going up to Pedro; bows.</i>) Do you know if Mr. Darblee be
in? (<i class="dir">Pedro shrugs his shoulders surlily and turns off; Dominique
turns to Manuel.</i>) Rheumatic? (<i class="dir">Manuel shrugs his
shoulders.</i>) Do <i>you</i> know if Mr. Darblee be in?</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">curtly.</i>) I do not. (<i class="dir">exeunt Pedro and Manuel.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">cheerfully.</i>) Must be a good disguise. The very man who
gave me the order to be here didn’t recognize me. I’ll try
uncle Darblee. (<i class="dir">exit; enter from mask niche, Mariana.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">looks around desperately; rings bell.</i>) I have no time in
which to do anything myself.—He may come at any moment
... (<i class="dir">writes hastily; enter Baptiste.</i>) Here. (<i class="dir">gives Baptiste
money.</i>) Take this note to the Governor. (<i class="dir">gives him
note.</i>) Use all the speed you can in getting there. Go!
(<i class="dir">half pushes Baptiste out of the room.</i>) I will beg his life of the
governor later, but now—I must save Jean.... May be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Mr. Darblee would help me. (<i class="dir">exit; enter one of Pedro’s guard;
he beckons to others who enter.</i>)</p>

<p>1st G. (<i class="dir">significantly.</i>) The Captain left orders that any man answering
the description he gave us should be searched.</p>

<p>2d G. Yes and any papers found on him brought <i>unopened</i> to him
at <i>Mme. Fantine’s</i>.</p>

<p>3d G. That’s singular. A prisoner’s papers are generally opened
before him.</p>

<p>1st G. That’s not our affair.</p>

<p>2d G. No. The only thing we’ve got to be careful about is not to
make a mistake in the man.</p>

<p>1st G. (<i class="dir">significantly.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>3d G. He isn’t expected to arrive before 3 o’clock. (<i class="dir">looks at his
watch.</i>) Twenty minutes from now.</p>

<p>1st G. He’s here now.</p>

<p>2d G. Ah, no.</p>

<p>3d G. He couldn’t be.</p>

<p>1st G. Did you notice a youngish looking man, with a straight
nose and a yellow cravat?</p>

<p>2d G. Why, he had a beard!</p>

<p>1st G. Yes,—and may be it’s his and maybe it isn’t. He didn’t
handle it as if it were.</p>

<p>3d G. You think?—</p>

<p>1st G. We’ve simply let him escape. (<i class="dir">enter Dominique.</i>)</p>

<p>2d G. Here he is!</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">bows.</i>) At your service.</p>

<p>1st G. Take off that beard.</p>

<p>DOM. What?</p>

<p>3d G. British spy!</p>

<p>DOM. Come, come.</p>

<p>2d G. Your airs of complacency won’t deceive us.</p>

<p>DOM. What the devil are you talking about?</p>

<p>1st G. Surrender!</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">angrily.</i>) I <i>am</i> disguised, (<i class="dir">switching off his beard.</i>) but
not a British spy. (<i class="dir">draws his sword.</i>) Now,—what do you
want?</p>

<p>ALL. You.</p>

<p>1st G. And a paper you have on you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) I have a paper on me, but you shall not have it.</p>

<p>1st G. Seize him!</p>

<p>ALL. Kill him! (<i class="dir">they fight; Dominique wounds 2d guard.</i>)</p>

<p>1st G. (<i class="dir">to 3d guard.</i>) Pin him to the wall. (<i class="dir">enter Lafitte; he knocks
1st guard’s sword up just in time to save Dominique; they fight,
3d guard engaging Dominique and 1st guard, Lafitte; Lafitte’s
sword breaks.</i>) Now, (<i class="dir">to Lafitte.</i>) Curse you, die! (<i class="dir">as
1st guard lunges at him, Lafitte grapples with him and clinches;
1st guard calls to 2d and 3d guards.</i>) Shall you let him escape,
you two! Kill him! (<i class="dir">2d guard resumes his sword; rushes at
Dominique; 1st guard speaks while struggling to get at Lafitte.</i>)
Kill him! (<i class="dir">Lafitte by a supreme effort, throws 1st guard from him,
causing him to drop his sword. Lafitte picks it up; wounds 2d
guard and knocks the sword out of the hand of the 3d guard.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. I command you in the name of Governor Claiborne to desist.
(<i class="dir">1st guard picks himself up from the floor; 2d and 3d guards
stand irresolute.</i>) Upon what charge do you seek to arrest
this man?</p>

<p>1st G. As a British spy.</p>

<p>LAF. Search him. I pledge my word for him.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">waving them aside; to Lafitte.</i>) The paper is for you.
(<i class="dir">Lafitte shakes his head.</i>) I insist.</p>

<p>LAF. Let them have it. (<i class="dir">1st guard searches Dominique; finds
paper; motions to his men; they station themselves besides
Dominique; 1st guard moves toward the door.</i>) Friend! If
you be honest you will read that paper before the prisoner.
(<i class="dir">1st guard hesitates; beckons to his men; they go to him; Lafitte
speaks hurriedly to Dominique.</i>) Back to back. There’s been
treason.</p>

<p>3d G. It’s nothing but fair.</p>

<p>1st G. And may be safer, since we have been charged not to make
a mistake.</p>

<p>2d G. We can say the seal got broken in the tussle. (<i class="dir">they return
and the 1st guard opens the paper.</i>)</p>

<p>1st. G. (<i class="dir">looks sheepishly at his comrades</i>;) A love affair. (<i class="dir">he
returns the paper to Dominique; exeunt guards.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">with a puzzled face, takes paper; he opens it, starts terribly;
crumples the paper into a thousand pieces in his clenched fist;
walks about in violent agitation.</i>) Oh, not to save twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
countries! not to save my soul from everlasting disgrace, will
I stop in my search now! Go! (<i class="dir">to Dominique.</i>) Fight indomitably.
General Jackson will tell you where. Here is
your commission as Captain.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">takes commission and in doing so, kisses Lafitte’s hand.</i>)
Can I not help you?</p>

<p>LAF. Yes. Fight for us both! (<i class="dir">exit Dominique by West entrance
just as Mariana enters.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">she sees Lafitte; speaks in a horrified, low voice.</i>) Jean ...</p>

<p>LAF. Mariana! (<i class="dir">he holds her in his arms silently; his cheek on her
hair; then holds her from him.</i>) You are well? (<i class="dir">Mariana
nods.</i>) Ah, (<i class="dir">folding her in his arms again.</i>) I have been
seeking you night and day; I must have left Barataria almost
in the hour you did; I have not been there since. I have
lived in terror. Even death has frightened me, since it might
claim me before I found you.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">starts</i>) Oh, Jean—</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">soothing her.</i>) All is well, sweetheart. My life belongs to
you. That is why it is a charmed life. Only a little while
ago, I escaped from the British. I was journeying along on
foot. Beppo kept me company. Suddenly, I heard the
tramp of horses. Intuitively I felt that they carried British
soldiers. I watched. A turn in the road showed me I was
right. I heard Captain McWilliams’ voice, I crouched in
the thick undergrowth bordering the road, I tried to quiet
Beppo. He barked. I—I was obliged to kill him in order to
prevent him from betraying me.... Not for the value of
my own life, but to save the country’s. (<i class="dir">Mariana put her
arms around his neck</i>) Then, so soon as they had gone by,
I borrowed a horse and came on. I have sent word to General
Jackson. There is no time to spare. Now that I have
found you and can put you in secure care, I must go. The
British are approaching. They are within nine miles of the city.</p>

<p>MAR. And you?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">tenderly.</i>) I, sweetheart, am Captain once more. Captain
Jean Lafitte, of the American army. Ah, there is so much
in my heart!—so much that I want to tell you about my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
hatred for the Spanish; my feint to the British Commission.
You don’t understand. I have never sailed under any flag
but that of the republic of Carthagena. My vessels are perfectly
regular in that respect. Carthagena is at war with
Spain. I capture and sink Spanish vessels and take possession
of their cargoes. That is the sum total of my offending.
When I shall have told you what we owe to Spaniards,—how
hopeless I was—</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">brokenly.</i>) I know—</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">compassionatingly.</i>) Sweetheart! (<i class="dir">kisses her.</i>) Now, let
us find Darblee. He will care for you until my return.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">detaining him.</i>) Not now.</p>

<p>LAF. I must go, sweetheart.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">half-sobbing.</i>) I want to see you.... I haven’t seen
you for so long....</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">passing his hand over her hair.</i>) Sweetheart—</p>

<p>MAR. Did you get my note asking you to come here?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">surprised.</i>) No.</p>

<p>MAR. Then <i>why</i> did you come?</p>

<p>LAF. To save Dominique. I was barely in time. (<i class="dir">leading her towards
the door.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">suddenly placing her back on the shut door.</i>) No!—You cannot
go!</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">in gentle remonstrance.</i>) Sweetheart—</p>

<p>MAR. You cannot go. The house is guarded!</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">dazed at first; then comprehending.</i>) And you?...
You wrote to me to come here?</p>

<p>MAR. The note was for Father Cuthbert. I had no idea ...
then I overheard Manuel and Pedro....</p>

<p>LAF. Manuel! Is he coming? At last! (<i class="dir">walks center; enter Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. Lafitte, General Jackson fears that the British are preparing
to attack by way of Barataria. He commands me to caution
you about the defense of that point.</p>

<p>LAF. Oh, I am perfectly confident of the fidelity of my men.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">grimly.</i>) They have had provocation.</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">indignantly.</i>) Provocation! At a time like this, to speak of
provocation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">doggedly.</i>) Yes. Now, they urge, is the time to retaliate for
all the persecution they have endured at the hands of the
Americans. Now. While the opportunity offers. All hail
to the Emperor of Barataria!</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">goes up quietly to Beluche and puts his hands on his shoulders.</i>)
Beluche,—we are first of all Americans. Who will follow
me must follow now not the Emperor of Barataria, but the
American soldier. Re-iterate my orders to the men of
Barataria. (<i class="dir">Beluche, humbled, bows; in turning he sees Mariana;
he starts and his face is instantly hard.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. It is well the men of Barataria don’t see you with this woman,
or they would refuse to obey your orders. (<i class="dir">exit.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">turns in bewilderment to Mariana.</i>) What did he mean?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">looks at him desperately; Lafitte waits; finally she puts out
her hands in dumb, piteous supplication.</i>) I thought my brother
had been killed ... and my uncle ... all those
helpless people....</p>

<p>LAF. Your brother? Where?</p>

<p>MAR. At Barataria ... shot ... by a band of pirates....</p>

<p>LAF. That man! The false commander of the Creole?</p>

<p>MAR. Yes.</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">takes her by the shoulders.</i>) You are dreaming! That man
was Colonel Tolosa; the man responsible for my court-martial
from Napoleon’s army; the man who came near separating
us forever. That was the man I ordered shot at Barataria.</p>

<p>MAR. And that—was Pedro;—the man who has trapped you here
now.</p>

<p>LAF. Impossible. He was buried at Barataria.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">shakes her head.</i>) He was saved by Father Cuthbert.</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">with sudden oppressive intuition.</i>) And you? What did you
do.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">puts out her hands blindly.</i>) I thought Pedro had been killed
... and I did not know him then ... I loved him with all
my heart ... and I believed you cruel as well as wicked....</p>

<p>LAF. Quick! What did you do?</p>

<p>MAR. I led an expedition against Barataria ... had the entire
Island burned and sacked and many of the pirates killed and
taken prisoners....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>LAF. Merciful heaven! I understand Beluche’s warning and the
peril of New Orleans! (<i class="dir">indistinct noises of voices heard without.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. Pedro and the guard! Ah, let me try to save you! (<i class="dir">falls on
her knees.</i>) On my knees, Jean!—for the love you bore me—(<i class="dir">Jean
lifts her from the floor.</i>) For the love you bear your
imperiled country.</p>

<p>LAF. Yes. Speak to Darblee if you can. He is one of my men
and will come to the rescue.</p>

<p>MAR. Yes, yes. (<i class="dir">she pushes Lafitte into the mask niche, following
him out of the room; Pedro, Manuel and the guard enter.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. An empty room! There has been treachery somewhere.
(<i class="dir">noise in the niche.</i>) What was that? (<i class="dir">he rushes to the door
beneath the mask; tries to open it; to burst it.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. That door is built against a wall; an annex made to the house
after it was completed.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">to the guard.</i>) Knock the lock off. (<i class="dir">they knock it off; the
door is swung open and reveals a solid brick wall.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. Just as I told you.</p>

<p>PED. Search the house. (<i class="dir">enter Mariana.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">in feigned joyful surprise, to Pedro.</i>) Pedro! (<i class="dir">going to him</i>)
Alive!</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">catching her arm; roughly.</i>) Where is Lafitte? Come, now.
I’ll stand no fooling.</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">quietly.</i>) I am in no mood for fooling either. I have not
seen Lafitte. (<i class="dir">softening.</i>) But you—</p>

<p>PED. The men swear they saw him enter.</p>

<p>MAR. I know he is not in the house, because he would have asked
for me. I was coming into this room just now, when I overheard
Manuel speaking of the use to which he had put my
note.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">brutally.</i>) What else did you overhear?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">looking at him calmly and unflinchingly.</i>) Nothing. I was
on the point of entering, thinking that Father Cuthbert might
be here, when I heard Manuel speak. Then I decided to
wait and see what came of my note before going to the Governor.
(<i class="dir">to Manuel.</i>) There was no need of concealment. I
would have helped you if I had known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>MAN. You would?</p>

<p>MAR. Have I not wrongs? I wrote to Lafitte, which must be the
reason of his non-appearance now, when as ill-luck would
have it, he escaped from the burning of Barataria. Yes,
that was my business the night of the ball; to beg the Governor’s
permission to lead the delayed expedition against
Barataria.</p>

<p>MAN. Why didn’t you let me know?</p>

<p>MAR. Because I wanted to do it all myself.</p>

<p>1st G. A woman <i>did</i> lead that expedition.</p>

<p>MAR. A woman did. She failed of her purpose then, but please
God, she’ll not fail now. I am on my way to inform the
Governor that Lafitte is to meet me a half hour hence at
the hotel <i>St. Philippe</i>. He will come, because he will believe
me to be repentant.</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">suspiciously.</i>) You still believe that he loves you?</p>

<p>MAR. Do not profane the word. I still believe that Jean Lafitte is
not a man to relinquish any purpose lightly.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">to 1st guard.</i>) Order eight of your best men to watch this
hotel. (<i class="dir">exit 1st guard; to Mariana.</i>) We will go with you
my dear.</p>

<p>MAR. I will meet you at <i>St. Philippe</i>. I wish to see Mr. Darblee
about my room first. (<i class="dir">moving towards door.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">agreeably.</i>) We can wait. Shall I conduct you to Mr.
Darblee?</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">baffled; speaks sweetly.</i>) Thank you. (<i class="dir">takes Pedro’s arm,
clock strikes 4.</i>) Oh, I haven’t time. I must go to the
Governor immediately.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">pleasantly.</i>) There is no need. A sufficient force will be on
hand. I have engaged to myself to capture Lafitte. We will
all go to <i>St. Philippe</i>; all—except the eight who are to watch
this hotel.</p>

<p>MAR. I’ll get my hat. (<i class="dir">Pedro crosses to door; holds it open for her.</i>)
The Governor (<i class="dir">aside</i>) will have received my message and sent
succor before they discover—(<i class="dir">exeunt Mariana and Pedro;
enter 1st guard and three others.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">to 1st guard.</i>) All right? (<i class="dir">1st guard bows; enter Mariana
and Pedro; Manuel advances; takes Mariana’s cloak from
Pedro; folds it lovingly about Mariana.</i>) Happy cloak, to enfold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
you so warmly! to feel the sweet, soft pulsing of your
heart!</p>

<p>PED. Ready? (<i class="dir">enter Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Stop!</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Lafitte!</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">to the guard.</i>) Seize him! (<i class="dir">the six guards rush upon Lafitte;
fasten his arms down.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. I give you warning! I belong to the American army. You
will pay dearly.</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">savagely.</i>) <i>You</i> won’t be the bill-maker, Emperor Lafitte.
(<i class="dir">to the men.</i>) Remove his sword. (<i class="dir">they remove it; Pedro takes
it; breaks it across his knee and throws the pieces aside; exit 1st
guard.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">turning upon Mariana in a fury of jealousy.</i>) So, Miss!
You still love this fellow! Well, American or not, he will be
put out of the way! Pedro and I have some scores to settle
with him. And as for you, my beauty—(<i class="dir">goes to Mariana;
she slaps his face.</i>) We’ll see! (<i class="dir">takes her forcibly in his arms.</i>)
call upon your determined lover now! (<i class="dir">kisses her; Lafitte
suddenly breaks the shackles that bind his arms; snatches a
small dagger from his belt and fells Manuel with a blow; then
he turns upon the crowd; re-enter 1st guard and eight armed
men.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">with his dagger in hand</i>.) Advance, cowards!</p>

<p>PED. His head, dead or alive. Fire! (<i class="dir">the eight men raise their guns;
Mariana screams; runs in front of Lafitte, clinging to him; at the same moment
a commotion is heard at the opposite door and a file of soldiers with raised
guns appears.</i>)</p>

<p>1st SOL. Hold!</p>

<p>PED. Fire!</p>

<p>1st SOL. The first man who fires will be shot! (<i class="dir">the eight men lower
their guns.</i>) Arrest these men. (<i class="dir">pointing to Pedro and Manuel; the
soldiers handcuff them.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. Upon whose order and on what charge?</p>

<p>1st SOL. Governor Claiborne’s order, on charge of being a British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
spy. (<i class="dir">to his men.</i>) Search them. (<i class="dir">Pedro and Manuel are searched;
the paper from Captain Lockyer is found on Pedro and handed to 1st soldier.</i>)</p>

<p>MAN. (<i class="dir">he is assisted to his feet; speaks with the borrowed strength of rage.</i>) Do
you know that it is <i>Lafitte</i> whom you have saved?</p>

<p>1st SOL. (<i class="dir">to his men.</i>) Lead them away. (<i class="dir">Pedro and Manuel are marched
off; exeunt guards and soldiers; 1st soldier goes up to Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>You had best use all dispatch in joining your command.
Every moment’s delay now is dangerous. (<i class="dir">bows; exit.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Mariana.... (<i class="dir">he gently takes her arm from his neck and raises her
head; she is dazed almost insensible.</i>) Sweetheart....</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">violently.</i>) No!—I cannot let you go! (<i class="dir">Lafitte kisses her; smooths
her hair; leads her to the door.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Good-by, sweetheart ... good-by.</p>

to be dealt with; twelve thousand to five. Relieve the forward

be here?</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">looks up; starts; looks at his picture; looks at Bella; puts the picture in his

<p>BELLA. May I see him?</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">coldly.</i>) No—</p>

<p>BELLA. Just a moment—</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">brusquely.</i>) Is not your name Cardez?</p>

<p>BELLA. Yes.</p>

<p>BEL. Ha!</p>

<p>BELLA. Do you know Captain You?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">grimly.</i>) I do and I can tell you that you need expect no
success in the practice of your wiles upon him, because I know
too, that you have another lover.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Who are you?</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">turning to leave her.</i>) All women are alike in their infamous
cruelty.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">runs after him.</i>) Please ... I must see him. He
may be killed.</p>

<p>BEL. Very probably.</p>

<p>BELLA. I want to ask his forgiveness for my foolish words—</p>

<p>BEL. Whose picture does that locket contain? (<i class="dir">pointing to serpent-head
locket on Bella’s neck.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. Promise to send Dominique to me and I will tell you.</p>

<p>BEL. May be.</p>

<p>BELLA. It is the picture of a man my mother loved.</p>

<p>BEL. Tell me the story.</p>

<p>BELLA. It was over in Spain. He was a Frenchman, but it seems
he had been intrusted by the Spanish government with important
papers with instructions not to let them leave his
hands except to the proper authority. My mother with a
girl’s caprice, begged to take them; was refused; begged,
pouted and finally had them read to her. She had been outspoken
in her love for this man, though my grand-parents had
betrothed her to my father. They must have overheard the
reading of the papers, for a few hours later my mother’s
lover was arrested and thrown into prison and his life saved
only on condition of mother’s immediate marriage to my
father.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) What!</p>

<p>BELLA. So you see, he must have believed—this man whom my
mother loved—that she betrayed him. (<i class="dir">Beluche bows his head.</i>)
And she, knowing that all hope was over, and knowing too,
his merciless, just nature did not dare to try to undeceive
him. Then my grand-parents died and when I was still a
young baby, my father died, leaving mother penniless. But
the world was bright for her once more, because for the first
time in two years, she had hope. She tried to find the man
she loved. She prayed to be able to tell him why she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
seemed to forsake him; to be able to beg his forgiveness for
all the misery she had entailed by her foolish insistence.
But when at last she came to a place where they had heard
of him, she was told that he was dead. And so, to lift me out
of the stress of dire poverty, she finally yielded and married
Leon Duval. They came to America and he made her a
good husband to the end.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">in a choked voice.</i>) She is dead.</p>

<p>BELLA. Yes—Poor mother!—Don’t you think it a fine face?
(<i class="dir">showing Beluche the locket.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. No—an idiotic face.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">warmly.</i>) It is not so. Mother could never have loved
other than a fine man.</p>

<p>BEL. Did she ever tell you his name?</p>

<p>BELLA. No.—Sometimes I think they may have made a mistake
about his being dead;—don’t you think so?</p>

<p>BEL. No,—he is dead. (<i class="dir">turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">puts her hand on his arm.</i>) You will send Dominique to
me?</p>

<p>BEL. Yes.</p>

<p>BELLA. Thank you.—I do like you. (<i class="dir">exeunt severally Bella and
Beluche; distant sounds of battle; enter several pirates; they
look surly, scowling.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. Do you hear that firing?</p>

<p>2d PIR. I’m not deaf. (<i class="dir">shivers; draws his coat about him.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. <i>I</i> don’t believe in Lafitte’s co-operation; I don’t believe he
advised our being stationed here.</p>

<p>3d PIR. (<i class="dir">savagely.</i>) If I thought we had been imposed upon—</p>

<p>1st PIR. Are we sheep that we are to be led to the slaughter in
this manner?</p>

<p>3d PIR. What can we do?</p>

<p>1st PIR. It’s our turn to relieve the watch next, isn’t it?</p>

<p>2d PIR. Yes.</p>

<p>1st PIR. Very well then. Wait in seeming acquiescence until the
British come—</p>

<p>3d PIR. And then? (<i class="dir">hoof-beats are heard approaching.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. Wave a flag of truce and let Captains Beluche and You
take the consequences. (<i class="dir">enter a mounted messenger.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>MESS. Captain Lafitte—</p>

<p>1st PIR. Is not here.</p>

<p>MESS. General Jackson orders him to take Battery 3 to the re-enforcement
of Coffee’s line. Captain Beluche—</p>

<p>1st PIR. Over there. (<i class="dir">pointing; exit messenger, the men following
him; distant sounds of battle; enter Dominique.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">worried and anxious.</i>) the idea of exposing herself in this
manner!—must be more of Lizbette’s counsel. (<i class="dir">stops; whistles.</i>)
I’ll bet that disguise was insisted upon at Lizbette’s
dictation. I’ve a great mind to try the prescription on Bella
herself. (<i class="dir">puts on disguise.</i>) She said she’d recognize me under
any disguise. (<i class="dir">enter Bella; Dominique goes up to her;
holds out both hands.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Who are you?</p>

<p>DOM. Your heart must tell you.</p>

<p>BELLA. Sir—</p>

<p>DOM. Do not speak hastily. I know I have seemed to do so, but
I could not help it. We may be interrupted at any moment.</p>

<p>BELLA. You have no right—</p>

<p>DOM. The best I love you.</p>

<p>BELLA. You do not know me.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">humoring the situation, but wholly in earnest.</i>) You are talking
nonsense. It is you who do not know me. My heart is
full of you. My soul seeks you even in sleep. I love you.</p>

<p>BELLA. You are insolent.</p>

<p>DOM. No. I am truthful. Why will you mistake? Do you not
feel that I have loved you for months: prayed for all chances
to meet you—to kiss you—(<i class="dir">attempts to kiss her.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">screams.</i>) Help! (<i class="dir">enter Duval.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">aside.</i>) The red beard! (<i class="dir">whips out his sword</i>;) Draw,
sir. (<i class="dir">Bella runs aside.</i>)</p>

<p>DOM. I refuse to draw.</p>

<p>DUV. Do you wish to be murdered?</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">coolly.</i>) I shall not be.</p>

<p>DUV. Take this!—(<i class="dir">he makes a pass at Dominique who dodges the
sword and trips him.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. Brute! (<i class="dir">she makes a dash for Dominique’s face; catches
his whiskers; pulls off his disguise; screams; Duval is up again
and on the point of resuming the attack.</i>) Don’t!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
(<i class="dir">to her father; throws her arms around Dominique’s neck.</i>)
It is Dominique. I love him. (<i class="dir">enter Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. And who the devil may Dominique be? A pirate, I’ll bet.
One of a band of sneaking robbers, too cowardly ever to fight
squarely and above board. (<i class="dir">enter men of Battery 4.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">with cutting contempt.</i>) But brave enough to <i>fight</i>, no matter
what the circumstances, when the country needs them.
(<i class="dir">the pirates settle about; play cards and throw dice.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. None of your insinuations. I would be fighting now, if it
were not for this girl.</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">to Dominique, aside.</i>) You’d better see to your men. They
are becoming moody. Lafitte’s absence pre-occupies them.</p>

<p>DOM. You think?—</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">gravely.</i>) Keep a close watch. I am taking battery 3 to
the re-enforcement of Coffee’s line. (<i class="dir">exit; Dominique turns
to exit.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">to Dominique.</i>) Stop! (<i class="dir">Dominique stops; to Bella</i>,) With
whom did you come?</p>

<p>BELLA. Baptiste.</p>

<p>DUV. Then go home with him.</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">kisses her father.</i>) Good-by. (<i class="dir">holds her hand out to
Dominique.</i>) Good-by. (<i class="dir">he comes to her; takes her hand;
kisses it; exit Bella.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">to Dominique.</i>) Now, sir!—I have no time to join the fighting
forces near New Orleans. I will follow you and settle
my personal differences with you later.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">bows; turns; makes a few steps toward exit, followed by
Duval; stops; starts.</i>) By heavens!—the British! The men
have let them pass without a shot! (<i class="dir">to his men.</i>) Forward!
(<i class="dir">men remain seated; continue playing.</i>) In the name of Lafitte!
(<i class="dir">all rise.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. In the name of lies! Lafitte is not here.</p>

<p>DOM. He would be here if he could.</p>

<p>2d PIR. He could be here if he would.</p>

<p>DUV. The British are advancing! (<i class="dir">to the men.</i>) In the name of
the country!</p>

<p>1st PIR. And of the legislators who offered rewards for pirate heads!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>2d PIR. Who had us shot like dogs!</p>

<p>3d PIR. Burned out of house and home!</p>

<p>4th PIR. Thrown into dungeons!</p>

<p>5th PIR. And liberated only in order that we might defend them!</p>

<p>ALL. (<i class="dir">in rage, making a lunge at Duval.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">darting in front of Duval.</i>) Back, cowards! Respectable
odds await you! (<i class="dir">the British open fire; pirates stand irresolute.</i>)</p>

<p>1st PIR. (<i class="dir">to the men.</i>) Come.</p>

<p>DOM. (<i class="dir">jumps on a knoll; levels his gun.</i>) I’ll shoot the first man
who retreats. (<i class="dir">men face about irresolutely; firing continues;
one man is wounded.</i>)</p>

<p>WOUNDED P. (<i class="dir">in a rage of defiance.</i>) Ah! (<i class="dir">switches out a large
white handkerchief; strings it to the barrel of his gun; advances
towards the British.</i>) We won’t retreat! (<i class="dir">pirates cheer and
rally marching around wounded pirate; firing ceases; Dominique
shoots down the flag of truce; the men in rage close upon Duval
and Dominique; another flag of truce is raised and the march
towards the British re-begun; meanwhile, above the sound of
their frenzy; are heard approaching cheers and hoof-beats by the
hundred; enter Lafitte followed by scores of his men.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. Men of Barataria to the front! (<i class="dir">snatches down the flag of
truce.</i>) Death to Wellington’s soldiers! (<i class="dir">exit; firing begins.</i>)</p>

<p>ALL. Lafitte forever! (<i class="dir">exeunt; furious firing, becoming momentarily
more remote; enter Bella, Mariana and Baptiste.</i>)</p>

<p>BAP. (<i class="dir">cataleptic with fear.</i>) Lordy! Lordy!</p>

<p>BELLA. Oh hush, Baptiste, you give me the shivers. (<i class="dir">to Mariana.</i>)
I’m glad I brought my cordial bottle, in case we get
too nervous.</p>

<p>BAP. Oh, Miss Bella, yo plumb rash to fly so in de face o’ Providence!
Lordy, (<i class="dir">kneels.</i>) please make ’em change dey mine,

Yes, Lord, I trus yo full an’ free.... (<i class="dir">a stray shot
sounds close and loud; Bella starts, dropping her cordial bottle;

running.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. Oh, I think we had better go, too. (<i class="dir">takes Mariana’s arm;
half pulls her off; enter Pedro.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">scantily clad.</i>) I made up my mind to escape. I’ve done it.
Hungry—chilled to the bone—with blood hounds on my track—But
if every other purpose I ever had in life fail, I will accomplish
that of my hate for Lafitte. (<i class="dir">reaches for his pistol;
holds his hand out; looks at it.</i>) Curse this cold! I can
scarcely hold my pistol. (<i class="dir">sees the cordial bottle; picks it up.</i>)
Ah! (<i class="dir">takes a drink; slaps the stopper back on and throws the
bottle down; makes a wry face.</i>) That’s queer tasting stuff.
(<i class="dir">the firing has ceased; enter Lafitte.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">anxiously.</i>) Surely she could not have been so imprudent—(<i class="dir">Pedro
sees him; creeps up behind him; aims waveringly.</i>)</p>

<p>PED. (<i class="dir">in choking rage.</i>) Damn— (<i class="dir">falls; dies; Lafitte turns; sees
Pedro; enter Mariana.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. Jean! (<i class="dir">Lafitte starts; throws his cloak over Pedro’s body.</i>)
You are not hurt?</p>

<p>LAF. Not hurt, sweetheart.</p>

<p>MAR. And the victory?</p>

<p>LAF. Is ours. I have just sent word to General Jackson. The
British have been routed with fearful loss.</p>

<p>MAR. And we?—Oh—(<i class="dir">seeing the covered form.</i>) Who is it?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">solemnly.</i>) A man to whom I owe much knowledge. (<i class="dir">Mariana
takes a flower from her breast, goes up to the body and places
it upon his.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">to some of his men who have come on.</i>) Take this body to
New Orleans for interment. (<i class="dir">the men carry it away; enter
Dominique and Bella at back.</i>) My sweetheart this place—</p>

<p>MAR. Ah, I am so proud of you! (<i class="dir">enter Duval and Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>BEL. (<i class="dir">earnestly to Duval.</i>) Your broken word would be a lesser
matter to you than your daughter’s broken heart.</p>

<p>BELLA. Oh, here’s my cordial bottle! (<i class="dir">picks it up.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">to Lafitte.</i>) I desire, sir, to congratulate you. (<i class="dir">shakes
hands; Bella goes to Mariana; Beluche and Dominique are
grouped together.</i>)</p>

<p>BELLA. (<i class="dir">to Mariana, showing her cordial bottle.</i>) Shall we take a
swallow,—just to settle our nerves? (<i class="dir">Mariana smiles; takes
the bottle; raises it.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">comes behind her as she is about to drink, takes the bottle from
her and throws it aside; happily.</i>) You need no cordial on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
such a day as this.</p>

<p>BELLA. All, my tonic is all wasted! (<i class="dir">enter a messenger on horseback.</i>)</p>

<p>MESS. (<i class="dir">dismounts; bows.</i>) General Jackson presents his thanks
to Captain Jean Lafitte for his efficient and loyal services;
also thanks to Captains Beluche and You, together with a
promise to grant Captain Lafitte any pardons he may ask.</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">bows.</i>) My profound acknowledgement and most respectful
homage to General Jackson. Do you know whether the
two men arrested at the <i>hotel des Exiles</i> have been executed?
(<i class="dir">Mariana goes to Lafitte’s side.</i>)</p>

<p>MESS. They have not. One of them escaped; is being traced
now. The other will be executed in an hour. (<i class="dir">Mariana
starts; puts her hand on Lafitte’s arm.</i>)</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">placing his hand over hers.</i>) Which one escaped.</p>

<p>MESS. Pedro d’Acosta. (<i class="dir">Mariana buries her face in her hand.</i>)</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">starts.</i>) Pedro d’Acosta arrested?</p>

<p>MESS. As a British spy.</p>

<p>LAF. I shall be very much in your debt if you will use all possible
speed in seeing the Governor and in begging him, in my name,
to spare Don Manuel d’Acosta’s life—and that of Pedro d’Acosta,
if he be caught.</p>

<p>MESS. I shall do so. (<i class="dir">bows; exit.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. (<i class="dir">to Lafitte.</i>) Do you think he will be in time?</p>

<p>LAF. Yes.</p>

<p>DUV. (<i class="dir">to Bella.</i>) Well, I will give my consent.</p>

<p>BEL. On one condition: that she give up her faith in Lizbette and
her practices.</p>

<p>BELLA. Dominique told you about that, but—I promise. (<i class="dir">exeunt
Bella, Dominique, Duval and Beluche.</i>)</p>

<p>MAR. Do you think Pedro will be caught?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">lovingly.</i>) It would not matter if he were.</p>

<p>MAR. But do you think he’ll be caught?</p>

<p>LAF. (<i class="dir">kisses her.</i>) No, sweetheart. (<i class="dir">passes his hand gently
over her hair.</i>) I don’t think he’ll be caught.</p>
